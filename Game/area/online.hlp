`iWere Creature/Hunter Q/A
`nWhat are Were Creatures?
`hWere creatures  are people who  have been infected with the were gene during 
their travels. Werecreatures  have the ability  to shift into their beastial
form, and back, without any harm  done to themselves or others`n*`h. In fact, 
when a  werecreature is shifted,  they tend  to be much stronger  than their
normal selves.  Each race becomes  a different  were creature.  Remort races 
are  excluded,  considered to be  much more powerful  than the  regular weak 
races,  they are immune to the were gene unless it was possessed before they 
remorted.  During a normal race's leveling experience, each level promotes a
fraction of a  chance that the race  will become either a were creature or a 
were hunter.  A were hunter is one  who has a devine sense  for sniffing out 
were creatures.  Were creatures and were hunters can sense each other, other 
people cannot. Were hunters,  unlike the creatures  which they hunt,  do not 
differ in   their abilities  from race to race, they each possess three like 
skills: Sense Were, Calm were and cleanse were.

`n* `hOccassionally,  the moon will force  the inner beast of a were creature to 
  emerge,  during this time the  were creature loses all sense of self for a 
  moment, and may or may not attack a fellow player in the room. 
`nWhat do the were hunter skills do?
`hA were hunter  will always be able to detect the presence of a were creature 
in the room, while they may not always be able to sense exactly which person 
has the were gene,  they can often  find out  through process of elimination. 
If you are a nopk were creature, do not worry,  the were hunter can not kill
you. However,  he can  'calm' you,  and  put you to sleep  using  his unique 
knowledge  of taming  the were creature.  Once  you  are put to sleep he can 
'cleanse'  you,  causing you to be  one step closer  to being healed of your
were gene.  the were hunter cannot cleanse you more than once a day. However,
three such  cleanses  will completely  heal you  and you will no longer be a
werecreature.
`nHow powerful are detect were and detect hunter?
`hThe werecreatures ability to sense  they are in danger is much  stronger than 
the  hunters  ability  to sense  who they hunt.  While a hunter  can feel the 
werecreatures presense if they are in the same room, a werecreature can sense
a hunter as soon as he or she enters their realm of existance.  Like the were 
hunters  however,  a were creature will not  know who is out to  cleanse them,
only that they are present.
`nSo, what were creatures can each race become?
`hFor this, I have contructed a chart.

`nOOC FACTS:
`n** `hWere Hunters will get a special prize each time they cleanse a were creature. A 
   were hunter will always be a were hunter - They cannot be cleansead or rid of this
   knowledge that the creatures are dangerous. 
`n** `hWere creatures can not speak while they are shifted. They have the power to shift 
   back and forth at will, unless the shift is forced by the moons.
`n**`h All were creatures possess the same weakness to silver.
`n**`h Each were creature possesses a different set of skills depending on his or her race. 
   If you are a wear creature, typing 'learn' will show you these skills. To learn them, 
   you must have 1 million experience and 1000 gold for each.
`n** `hThe chance to become a werecreature or werehunter is VERY slim. About .05% per level. 
   If you do get the weregene, you will be notified. Once you hit 90, if you still do not
   have the weregene, you never will.

draws a great deal of magical power from the Sidhe.

Block
``
Several hundred years ago a tired old monk named Bou-Ga invented a new 
skill, blocking. Being a cripple, and pretty old at that, he did not 
have the energy to jump around and dodge punches and kicks, not to 
mention weapons of all kinds. So he decided to use his hands and feet 
to block attacks. Sadly he did not have either the muscle mass or 
strength of bone to block more than one attack. But after Bou-Ga's 
burial, the rest of the monks decided they should give this new skill a 
try, and they actually managed to use it with much success with just a 
few bruises to show for their effort.

``The Monk Fighting Arts

``
In watching wild animals, Bou-Ga, the legendary monk, was inspired 
and based several fighting techniques on his observations. 
Among the famouns ones are:
``
`hArt of the Crane``
The monk uses slashing hits, usually against softer parts of the 
opponent, like the neck, face or artpits.
``
`aArt of the Panther``
Hammering blows are used in connection with this technique, 
slamming into the enemy's collar bones or preferably the face, of course.
``
`kArt of the Tiger``
The monk uses raking attacks to attack the opponent. It is used 
in combination with various gripping and tearing methods against 
groins, breasts and big noses.
``
`bArt of the Snake``
This technique applicates the monks fingers to pierce into the the 
opponent's too soft body (or eyes, ears and even between ribs).
``
`iArt of the Dragon``
This art uses the pure strength of the monk to inflict a terrible 
amount of damage. How it is used remains to be seen 
(preferably from a great distance).
``
Of course, Bou-ga was inspired by other creatures as well, 
like the frog, the buffalo and the swine. However, Bou-Ga never managed 
to get any of the other monks to try them out, so they died with him.

Monks train their hearing to pick up whizzling sounds

any penalty, should it miss.

# whirlwind~
Whirlwind

Bou-ga, the founder of many techniques, thought this attack up after 
seeing his wife accidently trample a bee hive and trying to fight all 
the bees off. Bou-Ga was later inspired to learn some new defensive 
moves, as his wife attacked him for not helping her killing the bees.
~

# fists_of_fury~
Fists of fury
``
This is the deadliest technique in the monk's repertoire of skills. Hitting the opponent
with incredible speed and fury the monk can even manage to knock the target out cold, 
after the damage is dealt.

The sweep skill is a highly evolved variation on kick.  An adventurer

adding an extra, powerful attack to their standard repertoire.  Though
masters in the art of sweeping can manage to avoid those known to be allies
with this attack, the wide angle of this strike may hit innocent bystanders in
addition to those the player is seeking to destroy.  Warriors, paladins, 
assassins and monks can learn to master the sweep maneuver.

HOLY CEREMONY

When one dies, he loses a portion of his exp.  If a cleric quickly prays
'Holy Ceremony' upon the victim, the victim will recover a portion of the exp
that was lost.  This must be done quickly, though, or else the departed spirit
will be lost.  The better the constitution of the victim, the more time he
will have to receive the holoy ceremony and gain back some lost exp.  The
cleric who performs the holy ceremony gets a portion of the experience as a
reward.  This can also be performed at the healer if there is no cleric to be
found.

   A character's life on Exodus is divided into three stages.  At creation,
   a character chooses a guild to follow.  For instance, a character named
   Possum chooses to be a warrior at creation.  The character is then
   considered a stage 1 warrior.  Any stage 1 guildmember has the ability
   to learn any skills, spells, songs, prayers, or chants of that guild up
   to level 30.  At level 31, Possum can either choose to continue to be a
   more advanced warrior, or he can choose to become any other class his
   race permits.  If he chooses to become an assassin, then he will be a
   stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin and will be able to learn skills
   up to level 30 in both guilds as his own level permits.  If he chooses
   to remain a warrior at level 31, he will become a stage 2 warrior.  Any
   stage 2 guildmember will be able to practice all stage 1 skills as well
   as the more advanced stage 2 skills of that guild.  Upon reaching level
   61, Possum will be given a third choice.  If he already chose to become
   a stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin, he might also choose to
   become a stage 1 thief.  He will be very well-rounded, but he will
   possess none of the advanced skills of any of the guilds he is a member
   of.  If Possum had previously chosen to become a stage 2 warrior and he
   wishes to stay a warrior, he can become a stage 3 warrior.  As a stage
   3 warrior, Possum will have access to the most advanced skills of the
   warrior guild, as well as all stage 1 and stage 2 warrior skills.

   Multiclass can seem a bit overwhelming, since there are over 100 paths
   a character can take.  If you are daunted by the choices, just remember
   you can always stay in your chosen guild and become a specialist and
   you will not be any worse off for doing so.

# builder_application~
`hSo you'd like to build on Exodus?  Great!  Building an area is something that
crosses everyone's mind at some point.  The trick is to figure out whether
it's a whim or a real passion.  We see players as our guests and customers.
Players are the reason we run this mud.  We look at builders as our
employees and we expect a level of performance out of them.  We have a
special port for building, which is seperate from the live port that people
play on.  The builder's port is a lonely place unless you are busy working
on an area, so if you just want a character to hang out, you will be very
unimpressed.  Also, we need someone who we know and trust, so you have to
have played this game for a while and built up a trust with the imms.  I
cannot tell you how many people have walked into Exodus and asked if we're
hiring builders.  The first question I always ask is "Have you played here?"
If you have not played on Exodus, how can you understand the theme of the
game and what kind of an area would be appropriate?  Also, you need to be a
literate speller and have decent grammar.  We don't expect everyone to hold
an English degree, but Exodus prides itself in the richness of its
descriptions and we would like to keep up a standard.  Exodus has a great
OLC, but there is still a teaching process involved and we don't want to waste
our time teaching someone who will build for a week and then give it up.
Lastly and most importantly, we need to know you actually plan to build an
area and not just study the game for your mortal alts on the live port.
You may laugh, but people have done this in the past and it amounts to
cheating.
`h
In order to be set up with an account on the builder's port, we need you to
do a little homework first.  Here's what we need you to have for us when we
start and remember that having this will help you when you start to build:
`k--`hWe will need a half-page description of the area you would like to
build.  Here is your chance to shine.  Impress us with the story behind
the place you want to add.  Tell us about the people in it and the
conflicts and events.  You don't need to be technical here, just let us
know that you have thought out a good well-rounded area.
`k--`hPrepare a general map of the area.  If you'd like to draw out every single
room, that's great.  If you only have a simple sketch of the layout, that's
fine too.  If it's on a sheet of paper, see if you can scan it and email it
to us or post it on a website and send us the link.
`k--`hWrite out at least five room descriptions.  We want to know what it will
feel like to walk through your area.
`k--`hWrite out at least three monster descriptions.  Pick your favorite mobs
and really give them some depth.
`k--`hFigure out how many rooms you will need.  This is another reason having
a map is a good thing.  You dont need to be exact, but be as close as
possible.
`h
If you have done all of this and you still want to build, then contact Minax
and we will talk about it.  Remember, if it's not fun, then there's no point.``

# delete~
DELETE
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice with your valid password
to delete a character, and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with
any other argument will return your character to 'safe' status if you change
your mind after the first delete.
``
Syntax: delete <password>
``
PS - While the deletion process itself is simple, disgruntled players will
often wish to make sure everyone else knows they are deleting. `o[HELP DRAMA]``
To assist in the process, a guide has been created listing a number of
popular methods by which a character can leave the world of Exodus.
``
1) The silent goodbye, Drama Level 0. The player simply deletes the character
and the world moves on.  While this method has the most class, it is the
rarest method used.
``
2) The goodbye note, Drama Level 1.  The player writes a final note telling
the world he/she is leaving and wishing friends well and wishing enemies
ill.  An email address is often left as well.
``
3) The cry for help, Drama Level 2.  This generally happens after a player
has experienced a perceived injustice and has usually decided to delete
already, but will give the imms "one last chance" by making a generally
unreasonable request, often on public channels.  When the request is denied,
the player will often follow step 2 or in extreme cases, step 4.
``
4) The angry spammer, Drama Level 3.  This character has given up all hope
of avoiding deletion and has decided to vent frustration to everyone because
he/she has nothing to lose.  Obscinity-laced messages on OOC are often
delivered in rapid succession resulting in loss of public channels.  If the
anger has not been satisfied, the angry spammer will often delete and then
log on an alt to continue the angry spamming.  You might think this is the
most extreme method, but sadly, there is one more type.
``
5) The war of attrition, Drama Level 4.  This character wishes to go out
with a bang, often utilizing methods 2, 3, or 4, but never method 1.  The
difference is that this character wishes to hang around to witness the
aftermath of his/her departure and therein lies the flaw.  How can you
witness the aftermath of a departure that does not happen?  Clever
players have devised a strategy to handle this problem by staging high
drama, then deleting, then logging on an alt to listen.  In extreme cases,
the war of attrition will continue long after everyone thinks it is over
because the deleted character will show up again and either make an
unreasonable request, complain that others are mistreating him/her, or
hang around and badmouth Exodus in general, perhaps hoping to catch a
newbie who is trying out the game for the first time.  DON'T BE THIS
PLAYER!``

# sewers~
The eastern sewers get their name because they run underneath the city of
Thesden from the east gate to the Severn river, therefore taking up the
eastern half of the city.  The sewers can be entered from any of the town
squares on the east side of Thesden.  People often use them for
surreptitious movement and to hunt the rats for sport and profit.  There is
also a rumor of a mysterious hermit who makes his home in the sewers, though
nobody really knows why.  
~

# merossa~
Merossa is a tropical port town located north of the eastern prairie
where it meets the ocean.  Unlike in the past, very few travellers come from
Merossa these days and the ones who do tell of an ongoing pirate invasion
and a deadly dragon who lives in the volcano to the east of town.  
~

# garden~
Located between the village of Fulk Nerra and the ocean on the north side
of the eastern prairie, the flower garden is a cultivated oasis in the midle
of the wild overgrowth.  A squad of gardeners and devotees maintain garden
tirelessly as several members of quasi-nobility lord over the place as their
own domain.  
~

# prairie~
Beyond the eastern wall of Thesden lies an enormous expanse of grassland
and rolling plains known as the eastern prairie.  It is largely uninhabited
and wild game roam freely making a perfect hunting ground for citizens.  The
prairie is bordered on the south and east by the great ocean.  Several spots
of development lie along the northen edge of the prairie, including the
Abbey of Erion, the village of Fulk Nerra, and the Flower Garden.  The
eastern road leads from Fulk Nerra to the eastern gate of Thesden, for east
travel.  
~

# eyunel~
King Eyunel's domain has fallen upon hard times.  Formerly a peaceful
human outpost along the stream north of the forest fierense, it has come
under seige by the evil Vro'ath.  Eyunel's elite forces have a definite edge
in skill, however the nubmers are against them and it appears to be just a
matter of time until the castle falls.  A great tree growing in the castle's
garden is said to lead to a realm of immensely powerful heroes and monsters.
Perhaps this is why Eyunel is so desperate not to let the castle fall.  
~

# gauntlet~
The gauntlet is a proving ground created long ago by unknown forces and
made to test the skill and cunning of adventurers.  It is said that once you
enter the gauntlet, you cannot turn back and must either finish the
adventure or perish within its walls.  The gauntlet can be found in the
northern part of the Macocaap outlands.  
~

# desert~
The desert of Ath'Tanar is a far off and dangerous sea of sand, where
scorpions and nomads prowl the dunes looking for prey.  The desert is
located on the western edge of another continent, far across the ocean.  It
is said that a town once stood at the edge of the desert, but as the winds
changed, it was consumed by the sands and the inhabitants fled, leaving only
a ghost town.  A few reports have also told of a giant stone pyramid,
although these may simply be legends.  
~

# morkoth~
Somewhere in the great ocean west of the sea of fate is a massive
whirlpool which swirls over the ruins of an ancient cuty that sunk into the
sea.  Grand streets of alabaster and marble are now travelled by sharks and
kuo-toa.  Ancient homes and buildings hide treasures and dangers long
forgotten.  The underwater ruins are ruled by the mysterious and evil
Morkoth.  
~

# pyramid~
The ancient pyramid lies burried in the desert of Ath'Tanar.  Very little
is known about why it was built or what it contains.  
~

# lunar~
``The Lunar Plains was once a wast underwater forest, but one day a dark tower made its appearance and
the surroundings started to change drastically. Animals, twisted by the evil that the tower radiated,
were now roaming what was left: the ever moonlit Lunar Plains.
~

# sense life~
``Sense life
``
Due to extensive training of all of the five senses,
(especially taste, monks never turn down a good meal) monks have developed a
heightened awareness of their surroundings.  Monks can sense hidden life
form edible mammal sentient close to them. 
~

# fighting arts~
``The Monk Fighting Arts
``
In watching wild animals, Bou-Ga, the legendary monk, was inspired 
and based several fighting techniques on his observations. 
Among the famouns ones are:
``
`hArt of the Crane``
The monk uses slashing hits, usually against softer parts of the 
opponent, like the neck, face or artpits.
``
`aArt of the Panther``
Hammering blows are used in connection with this technique, 
slamming into the enemy's collar bones or preferably the face, of course.
``
`kArt of the Tiger``
The monk uses raking attacks to attack the opponent. It is used 
in combination with various gripping and tearing methods against 
groins, breasts and big noses.
``
`bArt of the Snake``
This technique applicates the monks fingers to pierce into the the 
opponent's too soft body (or eyes, ears and even between ribs).
``
`iArt of the Dragon``
This art uses the pure strength of the monk to inflict a terrible 
amount of damage. How it is used remains to be seen 
(preferably from a great distance).
``
Of course, Bou-ga was inspired by other creatures as well, 
like the frog, the buffalo and the swine. However, Bou-Ga never managed 
to get any of the other monks to try them out, so they died with him.
~

# hear the wind~
``Hear the wind
``
Monks train their hearing to pick up whizzling sounds 
signifying a thrown weapon, so that they can avoid getting 
hit. As children the monks throw rocks at unsuspecting 
friends, though this behavior mostly result in practice of 
fist fighting rather than heightened awareness.
~

# split vision~
``Split vision
``
The monk has trained his peripheral vision to better fight multiple enemies.
~

# dirty tactics~
``Dirty tactics
``
This skill was actually quite recently developed by some drunkard monk, 
hanging out in the Outcast tavern in Thesden. He thought up several 
nasty moves that he used with great efficiency. Until one day when he
accidently poked his own eyes out and later walked off a bridge.
~

# fists of fury~
``Fists of fury
``
This is the deadliest technique in the monk's repertoire of skills. Hitting the opponent
with incredible speed and fury the monk can even manage to knock the target out cold, 
after the damage is dealt.
~

# penance~
Penance is a cleric prayer which allows the cleric to gain the favor of
his god in the form of mana.  He does this by sacrificing a portion of his
physical well-being as a show of devotion.  
~

# tempt~
A charismatic and experienced reaver may use his dark charms to tempt
another soul towards the darkness in their own heart.  If successful, the
reaver can tempt the target, drawing the target further along the path of
evil, eventually making the target as evil as the reaver is.  An
unsuccessful try at tempting someone is sure to enrage them to the point of
attacking.  
~

# repulse~
By showing the target the true depths of his evil soul, a charismatic
reaver is capable of driving an evil creature to the path of goodness and
forsaking the ways of evil altogether.  Attempting to repulse a target who
is more evil than the reaver is a pointless task.  Be careful, though, for
if you show your vile nature to a creature who is not repulsed, you may just
enrage it instead.  
~

# argent~
For almost a year following the great Cataclysm, the knights of the Order of Law bided their
time fighting off hordes of minor demons and dark knights, who came in seemingly unending droves
through tiny rifts spawned by the magical incident at the Tower.  Calling on their last vestiges of
communicative power, the knights of the Order of Law sent word to Thesden, seeking help from either the
Church or the powerful Order of the Argent Lance.  Both responded, dispatching battalions of soldiers and
armies of angels to quell the armies from within the rift.  With the combined forces, a holy seal was placed upon
the rift and the armies banished to eternity in limbo.
``
Ever vigilant, the Order of the Argent Lance promptly established a martial control over the stronghold
they defended, claiming that the sealed rift could present a problem in the future.  It is unknown as to
whether their assertions have merit, or are simply part of a ploy for power...
``
Be warned -- the knights do not take kindly to attacks of any sort, and should you murder another player
within the walls of the Stronghold, expect justice to be harsh.
~

# restore~
The restore prayer is the most powerful healing prayer in the cleric's
repertoire.  It is said that the power of the restore spell is enough to
heal even the most life-threatening injuries, leaving the target in a
perfect state of health.  This prayer has a heavy cost in mana for the
cleric who casts it.  
~

# falconry~
The most advanced rangers can now learn how to communicate with and befriend
falcons.  Falcons like staying outside though, so they will be of no help
to you indoors.  Falcons help them in several ways.
1. Falcons can alert you if aggressive mobs (or opposite clan members/loners
``  if you're pk) come within a certain distance to you by sqwuaking.  You
``  can turn this off and on via the `kfalconry on/off`` command.
2. Falcons can help you out in battle sometimes, swooping out of the air
``  and attacking your enemy for you.
3. Falcons can help you out by delivering items to others.  Try the `kdeliver``
``  command for the proper syntax.
~

# holy ceremony~
``HOLY CEREMONY
``
When one dies, he loses a portion of his exp.  If a cleric quickly prays
'Holy Ceremony' upon the victim, the victim will recover a portion of the exp
that was lost.  This must be done quickly, though, or else the departed spirit
will be lost.  The better the constitution of the victim, the more time he
will have to receive the holy ceremony and gain back some lost exp.  The
cleric who performs the holy ceremony gets a portion of the experience as a
reward.

# feigned amazement~
``Feigned amazement

Little Ompah was a less than clever man, he always fell for the 'look behind you!' trick. 
That was five hundred years ago, but even today monks use it against stupid opponents.

# knock~
Knock
``
It knocks the enemy out cold, neat huh?
~

# pounce~
Pouncing is a skill known more by the ranger's mount, than the actual ranger.
The pounce skill allows a ranger to urge his mount to pounce into an adjacent room
and land on top of his victim.  Skilled pouncers are said to be able to even knock
mounted victims off their mount.  Needless to say, only the special ranger mount
can be used to pounce.
~

# call beast~
Rangers are masters of the forest, and have thus learned to enlist the help of forest
creatures.  By using a special animal call, they can call for a special beast that
they can ride.  Since this beast only likes certain areas, it can be particular
about where it can be called to, and also where it will let you ride.
~

# disorientation~
The special ranger mount (acquired through `kcall beast``) secretes a special type
of venom, than the skilled ranger can used to "disorient" their victims.  Disoriented
victims cannot tell which direction is which, and when trying to run they wander in
random directions.
~

# fletchery~
Fletchery is the skill of making arrows.  Basically, to make an arrow you will need
a shaft (gotten from carving sticks), a feather, and an arrowhead, which you will
combine using the fletchery skill via the command "attach feather arrowhead shaft".
It is said the smarter rangers are masters of this skill, and such you may learn
a lot from enlisting in their help when attempting to learn this skill.

# trophy fishing~
`hTrophy fishing has long been a favorite pastime of the upper crust of Exodus.
The art of tracking, luring, and catching large fish possesses a draw that has
enthralled people of all status from royalty to the peasant adventurer.  It
is said that the ocean holds fish of all sizes, including several legendary
fish, which nobody really knows to exist.
`h
In order to properly fish for a trophy fish, one must first get a fishing pole.
The appropriate fishing pole can be purchased from the Emporium in Freeport.
Next you need some bait.  Every fisherman knows the best bait is a can of
worms, which can be found in Ebon Downs at the Fish and Tackle shop.  Be
sure to buy PLENTY of bait, because you probably won't catch a legendary fish
on your first try.
`h
After procuring the necessary equipment, it's time to head to sea.  Those who
are excellent swimmers can strike out on their own, while others may choose
to charter a boat.  Either way, sail out into the salty blue until you find a
spot you like.  There are several hot spots for fishing in the ocean and you
can never be completely sure where one will be, so if you fish for a while and
only come up with little fish, it may be time to move on to another spot.  The
closer you get to a hot spot, the larger the variance in the size of the fish.
`h
So, when you have found a spot, the next step is to [`khold pole`h] and then
[`kbait line`h] using your bait.  Finally, [`kcast line`h] to start fishing.  Wait a
little while to see if you get a hit.  Typically, a chance for a nibble comes
around a couple times a minute.  You can [`kreel line`h] to attempt to entice the
fish around you to take a bite.  Eventually, you will feel a tug on your line.
When this happens, it's decision time.  You can [`kreel line`h] to try to hook the
fish.  If it's a smaller fish, reeling right away will have a better chance of
hooking it.  For larger fish, you may want to wait until you get a stronger
pull on the line or else you might scare it away.  With a little skill and
luck, you will hook the fish.
`h
Once you've hooked the fish, you need to fight it to bring it in.  You will
see the line zig through the water.  When the line tension shows up as `j***`h
you should [`kreel line`h] and wait a few seconds.  When line tension is `i***`h it's
time to [`kreel slacken`h] so that you don't snap the line.  Larger fish will
fight more than smaller fish, so get ready for a challenge.  If all goes
well, you will eventually reel in the fish and have your prize.  If you
lose your bait or just feel like starting over, you can [`kreel all`h] to
start over.
`h
So why would anyone want to put up with all this nonsense just to catch a
silly fish?  Money and prestige.  Trophy fish can sell for incredible amounts
of money.  Even the smallest fish sell for a few gold.  Larger fish over 200
pounds can sell in the thousands of gold.  It is said that legendary fish
can sell for as much as 15,000 gold, although they are rarely caught unless
the fisherman has the good fortune to zero in on a hotspot.  Some legendary
fish even have their own names and reputations from those who have seen them
and lived to escape.  Worth even more than the money prize is the bragging
rights.  The heaviest catches will be recorded for posterity in the fishing
hall of fame.``

# mobblock~
edit the desired mob
set the act flag to 'blockexit'
set the exit direction with 'blockexit <direction/none>'
~

# noblink~
The command `knoblink`` makes it so all blinking text and all text with a background color
other than the default is shown to the character as the normal nonblinking color.  Noblink
is used as a simple toggle.  Type `knoblink`` once to turn it on, type it again to turn it off.
~

# peek~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or mob is carrying, and for getting a rough
idea of how much money they are carrying.  It is now a separate command, other than being
attached to the look command.  The syntax is `kPeek <name>``.
Beware, because although sometimes you might get away with no one noticing you peeking, you
can just as easily be noticed peeking, and most players don't take kindly to thieves snooping
around where they don't belong.
~

# archery~
The skilled archer can utilize a longbow or shortbow to fire arrows at their enemy.
Shortbows have less range and do less damage, but can be fired more rapidly than
longbows.  Quivers are a special container type that can only be used to hold arrows,
but hold arrows VERY efficiently.  The archery command is used `kfire person arrow``,
or for the lazy, `kfire person`` will choose the first arrow in inventory and use that.
~

# begging~
BEGGING
``
"Will someone level me?"  This has to be the worst question anyone can ask on
public channels.  It demonstrates a complete lack of motivation and interest
in bettering one's own condition.  It says to the world "I am lazy.  I do not
know my way around the game (which is ok) and I do not have any interest in
learning my way around (which is not ok) and I would rather gain the benefits
of being higher level without contributing anything positive to the world of
which I am a part."  If simply looking for a group to level with, try asking
"Are there any groups I may join?" or even "Would anyone care to level WITH
me?"
``
"Would someone give me some good equipment?"  This question may not sound so
bad at first, but when someone offers assistance in the form of asking what
equipment is needed, the response is usually "I don't know.  Something better
than what I have."  Once again, this demonstrates a complete lack of respect
for the players around you and for the world in general.  It's ok to ask for
assistance, but you should at least know what you are asking for.  Instead,
try asking "Would someone tell me which sword I might want to switch to from
this fine steel sword?" or "I have had a cypress staff for quite some time,
but I do not know which staff is a step up from it.  Would someone please
help me find a better staff?"
``
By letting people know that you are interested in improving yourself rather
just looking for a free handout, you will find that many players will be
much more forthcoming with information and possibly even direct assistance.

This would result in you OOCing 'Hi (Immortal name)' as many times as there are immortals.
~

# superduel~
Super dueling is a new style of arena fighting.  It's like a Battle Royale
in the sense that you take in all your equipment in, and nopks can fight and
avatars can fight without fear of permanent deletion.  You shouldn't be able
to lose equipment if you don't want to (IE it can't get destroyed by fire,
you can get disarmed and it dropped on the ground, you can't drop items, etc),
though you can still throw or assassinate if you wish.  The victors do NOT get
a piece of your equipment like in the normal arena.  The one main difference
is that it is a last man standing type match.  If you wish to start a super
duel, go to Hangman's Tavern, and type superduel.  It will be announced
globally, and you will be transfered to the waiting room for 2 ticks, so that
all who wish to join may do the same.  After 2 ticks, you are transferred
into a newly built arena just for this purpose, where you fight until one
is left, the victor.

# rules~
Within the realm of Exodus, there are some rules which you need to know and
follow.  They are here to promote fairness in game play, prevent harassment
of players and provide a general sense of order to the MUD.  Everyone is
welcome to join in the excitement on Exodus as long as these rules are
followed.  if you are caught breaking a rule, you may be punished by an
Immortal.  Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for breaking
a rule.  If you are uncertain whether an action is against the MUD rules,
feel free to ask an Immortal about it.  Immortals may be contacted directly
through 'tells' or by sending a note either to a specific Immortal or to the
Immortal group as a whole by addressing the note to "Immortal".

The rules have been broken down into the following help categories.  Please
look over every category when you have the time as they cover every facet of
Exodus game play.

Immortal Roles     Illegal PK      Indirect PK     Multikilling
Charmies and Pets  Cheating        Channel Abuse   Note Boards

# Player Killing~
Within the realm of Exodus, there are some times that individuals are not

# cheating~
CHEATING

Cheating is the premeditated use of an imperfection or error in the game
(known as a 'bug') in order to gain some kind of undeserved benefit or to
permanently change another player character's characteristics.  If something
seems to good to be true, it might be a 'bug', and you should report it to
an Immortal.  'Bug' abuse is a serious offense.  If you are caught abusing
a 'bug' the penalties that you are subject to can include a temporary freeze
of your player character, player character deletion, player character denial
or a ban of your internet provider's site.

The following is a list of rules to help you avoid the use of 'bugs':
   * Never use a skill which you do not have to initiate a battle.
   * Do not use arena gear for anything other than fighting inside the
     arena.
   * Do not use a skill in an abnormal manner (also known as 'spamming').
   * Do not order charmed players to change their alignment.
   * Do not mask your player character or name your pet with in such a way
     that you bear a strong resemblence to another character or mob.  Do not
     'spoof' Immortals without their express permission.
   * Do not use inherent world characteristics to kill or wound mobs.  This
     includes drowning.
   * Once in jail, do not escape or evade serving your sentence.

                      (also see 'help misconduct')
~

# harassment~
HARASSMENT

Harassment can include abusive and/or excessive repetitious action towards
another player character, which can include spamming spells or repeatedly
waking a character.  It is illegal to harass another player by sending
unwanted messages over any channel.  You must obey the request of any
mortal character if they ask you to cease communication with them through
any private channel like 'tells'.  If you use a public channel like 'gossip'
to harass a player, you may be asked to stop by an Immortal.  Additionally,
do not harass another player using 'emotes' or 'socials'.

If you are asked to leave a player's private room by the room's owner,
please do so or you may be punished for harassment.  You do not have to leave,
however, if you are initiating a battle with one of the room's occupants or
initiating an aggressive non-combat action.

Non-roleplay harassment found to be based on race, creed, nationality,
religion, sexual preference or gender will be punished severely.

Please note that because harassment is such a grave issue, if you are in
doubt whether you should or should not engage in a certain type of behavior
talk to an Immortal first before doing it.  Immortals will decide upon
what is and what is not harassment and will take appropriate action with
those found to be harassing others.
~

# alignment~
Alignment refers to your standing in relation to the forces of good and
evil.  High alignment indicates tendencies towards good, while negative
alignment means you are on the path to evil.  True neutral is 0 alignment
with -1000 and 1000 being the opposite extremes.

Whenever you kill a monster, it affects your alignment.  If the monster is
much lower level than you, the change is minor.  If the monster is much
higher level than you, then the change is more dramatic.  Here are a few
examples:

Bob the Paladin has an alignment of 500, meaning that he is good.

1) If Bob kills a demon whose alignment is -1000, then Bob's alignment will
   go up because the demon is more evil than Bob is good.
2) If Bob kills an evil goblin with an alignment of -500, Bob's alignment
   will not change because the goblin is just as evil as Bob is good.
3) If Bob kills a snake with an alignment is -100, then Bob's alignment will
   go down even though he killed an evil mob because the snake is less evil
   than Bob is good.  In fact, if Bob killed nothing but snakes that had an
   alignment of -25, eventually Bob's alignment would become 25.

The idea is that a person who slays slightly evil monsters is not as holy as
one who fights extremely evil monsters.  The same is true in reverse for evil
folks.
~

# reaver~
`hReavers are an evil cult of religious zealots who serve their Dark Lord`a
`hby destroying all which is good and pure in the world.  Just as the`a
`hPaladin serves the forces of good in the world, the Reaver is the`a
`hcounterpart, black-hearted swordsman.  The manifestation of the`a
`hReavers faith is the blade they wield the symbol of their cult.  The`a
`hReavers are based entirely around the blade, which is the only weapon`a
`hthey are allowed to wield.  This blade has a mind of its own and is as`a
`hmuch a part of the reaver as any other limb.  As the Reaver grows in`a
`hpower, so does his blade.  By capturing the souls of the slain, a reaver`a
`hmay feed the dark will of his blade and gain power through it.  Soul`a
`henergies of the slain are sacrificed into the blade like a type of`a
`hcurrency.  It is said that the developed blade in the hands of a skilled`a
`hreaver is a potentially unlimited force.  Reavers may also store spells`a
`hwithin the sword to be summoned forth at a time of their choosing.  A`a
`hReaver who strays even slightly onto the realm of goodness is rebuked`a
`hby his weapon, which abandons him until he returns to the path of`a
`hdarkness.  Note: Reavers have special commands involving their swords. `a
`h<sword options> shows what commands you may perform involving the sword. 
`a
`hSome sword commands may be performed anywhere and some must be performed`a
`hin the dark sanctuary of the Reaver guild hall.  All sword upgrades must be`a
`hperformed in the dark sanctuary.  The same is true for all blade and burst`a
`hspells, which can only be cast upon the sword at the altar of annihilation.`a
`hOnce spells are stored in the sword, they may be invoked anywhere.  The`a
`hduration of blade spells and the effect of burst spells is directly related`a
`hto the alignment of the Reaver--the more evil the Reaver, the greater the`a
`heffect.  When a Reaver dies, he must return to the dark altar in order to`a
`hinvoke his sword again, although any spells and upgrades will stay in the`a
`hsword.  Soul Energies (SE) are reaped from mobs based on their level and`a
`halignment.  Angelic mobs and more powerful mobs will give more SE.  Reaver`a
`hblades are open-ended, meaning there is no cap on the power one can imbue`a
`hhis blade with, although the cost of upgrading the blade increases`a
`hdramatically as the blade becomes more powerful.  Combat upgrades fall into`a
`hfour categories: Power, Hatred, Fury, and Strength.  Raising the Power of`a
`hyour blade will moderately increase the damage your blade can inflict,`a
`halthough you may not notice right away.  Hatred is a more dramatic and`a
`hobvious upgrade, but it is also more expensive.  Fury refers to the vigor`a
`hwith which the Reaver attacks the target.  Improving Fury will give you a`a
`hbetter chance of hitting your opponent.  Blade Strength is another aspect`a
`hwhich determines the damage done by your Reaver blade.  Try upgrading each`a
`hof them in turn to keep your sword balanced.  Before you can store a blade`a
`hspell in your blade, you must upgrade the sword to contain a slot for it. `a
`hYou may buy more than one slot of each type of blade spell, although the`a
`hcost goes up each time.  Once you have purchased a slot for a blade spell,`a
`hyou may go to the altar of annihilation and chant the appropriate blade or`a
`hburst spell.  If successful, it will be stored in the blade and will appear`a
`hin <sword options>.  Once the spell is stored, you may invoke it at any`a
`htime.  When you invoke the blade spell, you do not lose the slot in your`a
`hblade- it just becomes empty until you return to the altar and store`a
`hanother spell in the blade.`a

# mystery~
Word about town is that something has been troubling King Athanmere of late.
Locals overheard Lord Istian discussing the King's state with Lord Dare while
the two of them were drinking at the pub in Thesden.
``
"`hEver since those naval reports have come in, the King's not been acting right.
He seems distracted and he's holding secret meetings with his military
advisors,``"  Istian said.  "`hIt makes you wonder just what kind of news Naclario
and the navy brought back to him.``"
``
Lord Dare replied, "`hI don't know for sure, but I heard they were sailing far
off the coast and were not scheduled to return for several more weeks, yet
here they are.  I also noticed there seemed to be a few sailors missing when
they got back.  What could have brought the ship home so urgently?  Do you
think they ran into pirates?``"
``
"`hIt could be, but I seriously doubt it,``" said Istian again.  "`hPirates do
not often sail so far into the open seas and they almost always steer clear of
the King's royal navy.  Still, I hear that Admiral Blacksail in Freeport
has close ties to several pirate groups.  If pirates were involved, he would
be the one to ask.``"
``
At that point, the two lords finished their drinks and left the pub.

# misconduct~
MISCONDUCT

Misconduct is any action which has been declared by the Immortal Staff as
being inappropriate and/or unfair for various reasons, and does not imply
lesser offenses.  The following is a list of rules which you need to
follow to avoid punishment due to misconduct:

* Do not lie to an Immortal. 
* Do not disobey an Immortal's direct order. 
* Do not purposely lock a Sidhe in battle with a blunt attacker. 
* Do not use a MUD client program to play for you while you are away from
your computer. This is known as botting.  You must man your character when
on Exodus.
* Do not attack a player character on an Immortal-run quest, when that 
player has 'quest' in their title. (Unless otherwise indicated by the 
Immortal running the quest.) You MAY pk/get pked during autoquests 
(like the rat quest) 
* Do not spread plague in Thesden.

# suck~
The suck skill is used by Kalians to drain the lives of their victim.
~

# fear~
Fear is used by Kalians to force their opponents to run in fright from the fight.
Their opponents are then too scared to challenge the Kalian again, or sleep.
~

# illusion~
The ancient art of illusion is known only to Kalians, and allows them to make a
clone of themselves that others may deem VERY real.
~

# awareness~
Awareness is a monk skill that allows the monk to not only block an incoming attack,
but prevent the fight entirely.

 A super quest item is a customizable weapon or item that lets the designer
 pick what elements are important to the creator.  In the case of a weapon,
 the quest item starts off with average 30 damage in any weapon type except
 exotic.  As a piece of equipment, it starts off with a respectable 20 AC in
 all categories.  Super quest items can never be improved by imms once they
 are created.  A super quest item can have up to five bonus points for free.
 After that, you can add up to five more points, if you balance it back down
 to the initial five.  The owner flag is automatically added to all Super
 Quest Items, and they are also automatically acid and fire proof.

EGL is the Exodus Gladiator League.  It's not a tournament so much as an
ongoing PK season.  Think of it like a football season.  Every fighter will
fight every other fighter at least one time with points and ratings gathered
along the way.  There is no elimination system during the regular season.  A
playoff might happen depending on the size of the league.  Oocnote or tell
Minax if you'd like to join.  Standings will be kept and publicly posted as
the season goes on.  Registration for season 1 is now closed.
`o
Official EGL website: `khttp://exodus.devinbrown.com/egl.htm ``
``
Here's the rules (there ain't many)
Fights will be 1 v 1 in the Superduel Arena.
Use any equipment you like, but no potions/pills/scrolls/staves/wands.
Fights start with nothing but racial effects on the fighters.
The official will intervene to keep players from starving or dehydrating.
The official can impose penalties for stalling.
I'll need registrants to update their email info so I can schedule fights.
If you miss a fight, you just lost.  Give me as much notice as you can.
The official can instantly end a fight if someone pulls BS stunts.
Once a fight starts, a winner WILL be declared.
No reincarnating during the season.  TALK TO MINAX BEFORE YOU DO!
``
All fights will be logged.  Fights don't count unless an imm is
officiating.  All participants will be rewarded and winners will be
rewarded as well.
``
Every contestant gets 1 quest point per fight for participation.
The above prizes are awarded at the end of the season to ensure participation.
The champion gets a unique item utilizing soon-to-be-available technology.
The champion gets a statue in his/her honor in a prominent location in Thesden.
Quest Points can be awarded on the spot for particularly entertaining fights.

# k ball~
`aNecromancer``
`h
`aMasters of the darkest secrets and most frightening powers, necromancers`h
`aare mages who have chosen the path of evil for their studies.  Necromancers`h
`aare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand`h
`acombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer`h
`aand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between`h
`alife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to`h
`aanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. `h
`h
`aNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and`h
`arituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to`h
`aperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a`h
`afocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,`h
`ahexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects`h
`arespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer`h
`athey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the`h
`anecromancer's own blood to draw. `h
`h
`aUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which`h
`atype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are`h
`askeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a`h
`anatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.`h
`aWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come`h
`afrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always`h
`abeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a`h
`aplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains`h
`aand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that`h
`aphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some`h
`ainnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in`h
`acombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty`h
`aapparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark`h
`ahood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be`h
`aunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for`h
`aa lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies`h
`afrozen with fear.`h

			        `f[`hLitans`f]``
The creatures known as Litans are said to have come from the far deserts
of Ath'Tanar, a mystic race of reptilian beings for whom sand, fire, and
extremes are a way of life.  Litans in their home environment are nomads,
living in dynamic, socially ordered tribes with very little outside contact.
Their appearance is humanoid in general form, having four limbs and walking
upright - but there the resemblance ends.  Their bodies are covered in dull
scales, ranging in color from a light yellow, almost white, to a deep
black-red.  Their faces are featureless, smooth and rounded, with eyes like
gleaming coal-black slits.  Their feet have three clawed toes, webbed to
assist them in navigation of the sandy dunes.  Probably the most interesting
aspect of creatures is the slimy secretion that covers their scales.  This
substance is highly flammable, and the Litans have developed a specialized
method of utilizing it - two of their teeth are ridged, and can produce
sparks if clicked together properly, sending the Litan up in flames.  It is
an unnerving sight for those unaccustomed to Litans to see one in this
state.  They are, however, immune to heat and fire, and will never be
damaged by them, so to a Litan, setting oneself on fire is part and parcel
of life.
Litans are a proud race, temperamental and stubborn.  Their cultural
tradition of tattooing their scales with flamelike and lightning patterns
stems from the love of broadcasting their greatness to the world.  They
boast and brag of their accomplishments and prowess to anyone near them - a
habit that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with those more powerful
than they.  In addition, they tend to be explosive and fiery, like the
substance they secrete.  Unfortunately, not being the most intelligent
beings, they don't always make good judgements and sometimes end up dead for
it.  Although Litans can form bonds of friendship, they generally have no
familial ties or maternal instinct, and the concept of 'marriage' is a
foreign one - mating is done easy-come, easy-go, generally when tribes meet
in the desert, and they lay eggs deep underneath the sand.  Their eggs are
fabled objects, being extremely hard to find and very beautiful.  Most are
slightly incandescent, glowing softly from within, while the outer shell is
anywhere from creamy off-white through yellow, red, and pitch black, some
shaded and marbled beautifully. 
Due to a peculiar forked tongue and rigid palate, Litans are unable to
communicate with other beings by normal means.  Instead, they use a
high-pitched shriek, much like a shout, which can be heard from long
distances.

A garden was built around the largest oak tree outside of Thesden,

Thesden grew and came closer and closer to the giant tree.  And the tree
grew and shaded more and more of Thesden.  A garden was eventually erected
to save the old oak when rumors about it being removed for a new tax office
were murmored throughout Thesden.  Now the garden, and the tree are places
for lovers to meet, and people to greet the furry wildlife that play in its
branches.

# assassins~
`hAssassins are masters of efficient and practical combat.  Not possessing the
staying power or defensive capabilities of the Warrior, who prefers a
face-to-face fight, the Assassin is a specialist offshoot of Thieves.  The
Assassins trace their roots back to a secret society who split from the
Thieves' guild long ago, the Assassins have abandoned many of their former
skills in favor of concentrating purely on the aspects of combat that win
the fight.  They are not bound by the honor of the Paladins.  They are not
made to engage in static combat like the Warrior, yet the Assassins have
managed to acquire several techniques from those traditional classes to
replace the discarded skills they no longer have any use for.
`h
Assassins may seem similar to Thieves, and Thieves are the closest class to
them, but Assassins are pure killers, and as such possess only the skills
of killing.  The primary attribute for the Assassin is dexterity.
Specialization has benefits, but also disadvantages.
`h
The philosophy of quick death on the move has no room for the use of some
cumbersome equipment, which means that Assassins never use shields.
Furthermore, Assassins are all marked men and women.  If they show their
faces in public, they may be attacked on sight with no level restriction
protection and with no nonclan status protection either.  An Assassin must
be neutral or evil.

# battle royale~
`iBattle Royale`h is a free-for-all Playerkilling bloodbath.  Everyone and anyone

`o
You may be killed OOL.
You may be killed in justice rooms without causing a wanted flag.
You may be killed even if you are not in a clan.
Multikill `wIS`h allowed unless the imms specifically say otherwise.
`h
Scoring:
You receive 1 point per level of the victim.

The Battlefield:
Battle Royale takes place in a large, but limited battlefield consisting of
the following areas: `kThesden`h, `kEastern Prairie`h, `kForest Fierense`h, `kFulk Nerra`h,
and the `kEastern Sewers`h.  You are prevented from entering any other area

# buildtraps~
BUILDTRAPS 
``  
Traps can be made using the olc object editor. 
First set the object type to roomtrap, objecttrap, or portaltrap 
Then set v0 to the traptype. ("? traptype" for possibilities) 
Setting the trap type will set default damage and trap flags, these 
can be modified by setting the various values and trapflags. 
See "? trapflag" for a variety of affects that can be added to a trap. 
The excellent trap flag makes a trap do 150% damage and is mainly used 
for player traps. 
Trap dex is an important parameter for in-game traps, since most trap 
skills compare player dex with trap dex, but is not important for player 
set traps since the install command sets the dex when the player installs the  
trap. 
``
The summon mob value is an optional value and if not set to 0, will attempt to 
summon the mob corresponding to the value and force it to attack the victim. 
``
Traps also have two extra keywords that are used to store message, they are 
specmessage and victmessage.  Change these to whatever message you would like 
the trap to say to spectators and victims of the trap.  In these you may use 
certain  things to refer to the victim.
``
$N or $n: players name N capitalizes it 
$E or $e: he,she, it depending on sex 
$M or $m: him,her, etc 
$S or $s: his, hers, ... 
``
Lastly, traps are automatically set as wizi.  A wizi invis trap is an armed trap. 
If you are making traps for players to use, you must remove this flag before they 
can use it.

# miverblis~
`hMIVERBLIS`a
`a
`cYou start the game by typing "CARDDUEL PERSON" and that person can accept your`a
`cchallenge by typing "CARDDUEL ACCEPT". You can also challenge several people in`a
`cthe room by typing "CARDDUEL ALL".`a
`a
`bANTE`a
`cBefore the actual gameplay starts, ANTE will be chosen and put into the ante bag.`a
`cThis is done by typing "ANTE ADD ITEM". Each player can check what is in`a
`cthe ante bag by typing "ANTE LIST". When a player has accepted what is in the ante`a
`cbag he can type "ANTE ACCEPT". If a player decides that he does not want to`a
`cparticipate in the game (for example if the opponents only submit crap to the`a
`cante bag) he can type "ANTE DECLINE". When the ante is handled and every`a
`cparticipant has accepted, it is time to start the game.`a
`a
`bGAMEPLAY`a
`cTo start off, the first player is chosen, this will be the one who starts the`a
`cfirst round, consequently a last person is chosen. The last person gets to draw`a
`cone extra card (8) where everybody else draws 7 as their opening hand. The last`a
`cplayer also gets to play the first terrain card from his hand, this terrain card`a
`ccannot be replaced until the second round of playing.`a
`a
`cEveryone plays a mob card from their hand, this will be their MAIN MOB; if this`a
`cmob card is dispatched, the owner of that mob card has lost. The MAIN MOB`a
`cautomatically gets 10 HP, no matter what previous stats it might have had.`a
`c
`cOn each player's turn, he gets to play either a terrain card or a mob card. If`a
`ca player chose to play a mob card, he may not attack. A player may only have two`a
`cmobs in play at any given time (including the MAIN MOB).`a
`a
`cWhen a player attacks an opponent, that opponent gets to chose a defending mob.`a
`cWhen this is done, any player may choose to play spell cards, but only one of `a
`ceach type (counter cards are except to this rule).`a
`a
`bTERRAIN CARDS`a
`cAs you play the game, you will notice that some of the mob card races get certain`a
`cbonuses in different terrains. Terrains may also affect which spell cards you`a
`cmay play, some can stop you from playing healing spell cards, others can stop you`a
`cfrom countering. Some terrain cards give bonuses to elemental mobs, while others`a
`cgive bonuses to non-elemental mobs.`a
`cThere can only be one terrain in the game at any given time.`a
`a
`bCOUNTER SPELL CARDS`a
`cThese cards can be used to counter the affect of another spell card (even another`a
`ccounter card). You cannot counter mob or terrain cards.`a
`a
`bHEALING SPELL CARDS`a
`cHealing spell cards can either heal a mob card, or prevent damage done to it.`a
`a
`bBOOST SPELL CARDS`a
`cA player may play boost spell cards to temporarily (one turn duration) enhance the`a
`coffense, defense of a mob; or both. Boost spell cards can also lower the target`a
`cmob cards defense and/or defense.`a
`a
`bDAMAGE SPELL CARDS`a
`cIf a player wants to deal extra damage to a mob, the damage spell card is one of`a
`cthe options. Damage cards, like mob cards might have elemental properties (more`a
`cabout that later).`a
`a
`bELEMENTS`a
`cSome mob cards and damage spell cards have elemental properties. This basically`a
`cmeans that they have a strength as well as a weakness.`a
`a
`eWater`h is strong vs`i fire.`a
`iFire`h is strong vs`d stone.`a
`dStone`h is strong vs`k lightning.`a
`kLightning`h is strong vs`e water.`a
`a
`cExample: If a water mob attacked a fire mob, the water mob would get +1off/+1def.`a
`cExample: If a stone elemental damage card was played on a fire elemental`a
`cmob card, it would do 1 less damage.`a
`a
`bCARD COST`a
`cPlaying your cards is not free, it will cost as much silver as the value of your`a
`ccard. This silver is put into a pot that will be given to the winner of the`a
`cgame.`a
`a
`cWhen you are the last player standing, and all of your opponents are defeated, you`a
`cwin and collect the contents of the ante bag.`a

# scorch metal~
Syntax: chant 'scorch metal' <target>
``
Scorch metal is a powerful reaver attack chant, with effects that vary
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.

# woodworking~
WOODWORKING
``
With skill in woodworking, a Ranger can start with a tree and end up with
all sorts of useless and useful items.  Woodworking is broken down into three
steps:
``
`oCHOP`` down a tree with an axe
`oMILL`` the fallen tree into lumber
`oCARVE`` the lumber into various items with a dagger
``
The larger the tree, the longer it will take to chop down, but the more wood
it will produce when milled.  Different types of wood will have different
attributes.  Some rarer trees--Jewelwood and Moonblossom, among others--have
strong magical properties which are passed on to the item that is created from
their wood.

# purification~
Syntax: pray 'purification' <character>
``
Purification is a prayer by which a cleric can call upon the power of
the gods to attempt to remove the magical effect of an ally.  In this
regard, the prayer is similar to the mage spell 'ancellation'and is
unlike the spell 'dispel magic' which is considered aggressive.  If the
prayer is successful, both helpful and harmful spell effects are removed
from the character.
``
Success is based on the level of the caster and you will find it very
difficult to use purification to remove spell affects of a higher level
than the cleric.  Purification will not aid in the removal of some
spells, such as plague and poison.
~

# disarm~
syntax: disarm <target>
``
Just as you would expect, disarm is a skill by which virtually all of
the fighting classes may attempt to remove an opponent's weapon.  While
having great potential, this skill is relatively unreliable, even for
those who have mastered it.  Persitience is usually required in order
to successfully disarm an opponent.
``
Disarm can only be used while in combat.  Against non-player characters,
disarm is generally even less reliable as the disarmed opponent will
quickly snatch up its weapon, although only rarely will it be wielded
again.
``
Cursed weapons can be disarmed, but they are not dropped because of the
curse.  It is said that if you wish to disarm a swordsman, you will have
the best success if you are a master of the sword as well.  The same
holds true for all weapon types.

# names~
Until now, the rules on naming your alt have been very..  Non-existant. 
I'm not going to be a tyrant and say that only strictly mideivel/fantasy
names will be allowed.  So this is just to help you understand what is ok
and what will make me change your name.  Acceptable names would be anything
you make up that sounds nice, anything you got from a book, a movie, a game,
or even a TV show.  Like I said, I'm not going to say you HAVE to have a
mideivel name (although it is nice), so if you want, go ahead and name
yourself Fred.  Names that AREN'T acceptable are vulgar or suggestive. 
Example "Siemen".  Something like that will NOT pass for "Simon" and will
result in a request to change your name.  Also, stringing together phrases
is riduclous.  Example "fillupmytank" is NOT a name, it doesn't even
remotely resemble one.  Using nouns as names will be accepted under certain
cercumstances.  For example, "Storm" is a fine name.  However "Penis" is
not.  If you use undying wit and originality to break the rules, they will
be accepted.  An example here is "Mendou" the name is perfectly innocent and
relevent until broken down into "Men Do U" This technically breaks the
rules, but is too funny and well masked to really piss me off.  So in
conclusion, please follow these (rather lenient) rules, and if you must
break them, be original.  `` -Sallana

# advocation~
`gFrom the grand terraces of `nIlewyn`g and the shaded branches of `nLinden`g,
from the outlying forests and farms, we came.  We came to Thesden seeking a
better life, and greater opportunities.  We had all heard of grand Thesden
with its streets of gold.  Upon our arrival at the grat city, however, we
found the stories of Thesden's grandeur to be misleading at best.  Thesden,
whatever it once might have been, is now crumbling into decadence and decay.
Bandits roam the streets freely, while the town guard looks on unconcerned. 
Dangerous creatures roam the lands around Thesden as well, waiting to devour
the unwary traveler.  Even so refugees from other lands from to Thesden
daily seeking a new life.  More often than not, they are easy prey for
predators inside and outside the city's walls.  The aristocracy, for some
reason, seems to ignore these ills.  The problems of society are ignored at
best by the ruling class.  At worst, the nobles of the day care nothing for
those under their rule, and crush them down with oppressive edicts and
taxes.  We of Clan Advocation are pledged to help others when we can,
especially those who are new to the lands and less able to fend for
themselves.  We have foresworn violence against other clans and loners. 
Whenever possible, we will do all we can to better the conditions of all

`iOOC NOTES:  (Important)
``
Clan Advocation is partially IMM run, the clan is not for PK. This clan is for people who wish to lend a hand to new  players, and who wish to strive to do everything they can to raise the player base of
this game by being kind, considerate and helpful. If you join clan Advocation, the alt you join with can NEVER go PK again. You may leave the clan, but will be unable to convert to pk. With this
method I hope to prevent people from joining for clan gear, and leaving to PK. The clan gear Advocation offers is the best because it's for players who will be risking their lives to help others 
equip, raid or get out  of a sticky situation, and will NEVER be used to get one up in PK. Because of this, any memer of clan Advocation is also banned from Battle Royales, Super Duels, and the
Arena. The portals in the clan hall are for getting to people in need FAST. They are not for helping someone PK in anyway. Lastly, being a part of clan Advocation means taking on an extra burdon.
It means not only must you answer anybody's call for help, no matter how stupid it may seem, as long as you have the Advocation clan symbol infront of your name, you help them. In addition to 
helping mortals, you will be higher up the ranks for helping immortals come up with new ideas for quests, classes, races and anything else that might help the games progress. And on the very final 
note: Any player to find a way around any  of these rules will be kicked out of Advocation, frozen for life, and banned for four weeks.

note to the immortals vouching for your remort.  It is important that you
feel you were both given a fair task and judged fairly.  If you feel you
were not, note an immortal about it, and give full details.
`a
`i-*- Your Role Playing Duties -*-``
`a
Kalians who are already remorted, congratulations.  However, you now hold
the enourmous task of upholding the RP that has been brought to the Kalian
role.  I believe that there should be one race that has to be RP down to the
bone, and Kalian just so happens to fit that image.  I encourage all kalians
to use OOC sparingly.  All kalians should have somewhat of an abrasive edge
to them.  You should outwardly react to sunlight.  Don't forget to bring
your own style of RP to the role.  If at any time Myself or another immortal
feels any Kalian is slacking in their Role Play, they will be stripped of
the race and turned back into the previous race that they were.  If you need
more help on RP feel free to ask any immortal.
`a
`i-*- Being an Adept -*-``
`a
More important for you to take seriously than even the strict role play,  it
is up to YOU whether or not another player becomes a kalian.  You must NOT
let ooc or personal issues cloud your mind.  The best way to go about
recruiting another Kalian is to wait for someone to ask you for a Vouch.  Do
not immediately say yes or no.  Give them a 'task' that will test their
knowledge of the game as well as their role playing skill alike.  After they
have completed this, use your HONEST judgment on whether or not they deserve
to be remorted.  If you decide that they do, you should pen an RP note to
Immortal explaining what you had them do, and why you feel they deserve to
be remorted.

# clan item~
Clan gear has changed.  Instead of the old days where each clan had 5
pieces of gear in various slots, they each now have one piece of gear in one 
slot.  This piece of gear of course has to compensate for the 5 lost items,
so here are the guidelines for your clans item.  Much like an SQI, we start
off with points.  However there are more stipulations with your clan item. 
Unlike an SQI your clan item may not have any perm affects.  It may not have
any skills added to it.  If you are an old clan creating your first single 
clan item, the decision is primarily that of the clan leader, but I
encourage you to talk it over with the rest of your clan.  
``
If you are a new clan and wish to make your first clan item, 
the cost will be 25,000 gold. This does not include the additional cost of your 
shopkeeper, which will be 10,000 gold.
``
Each bonus to your clan item starts out at the cost of one point.
For each additional bonus of the same attribute, you add another point.
IE: if you get +5 hit/dam, it is one point. If you get +10, it is 3, +15 is 6, and so on. 
``
`hYou have `k20 `hpoints to spend.``
`h
`j+ 5 hit/dam `h..`k1 `hpoint
`j- 50 AC`h.......`k1 `hpoint
`j+ 50 HP`h ......`k1 `hpoint
`j+ 50 mana`h.....`k1 `hpoint
`j+ 50 Move`h.....`k1 `hpoint
``
To eliminate any confusion I am going to reiterate this system by making a sample item.
I will add +5 hit and dam, for 1 point. I will add another for an addition 2 points. 
This brings me to 10 hit/dam, and I have spent 3 points.
Now I will add - 50 ac for 1 point, and additional - 50 for 2 more, and another for 3 more.
this brings me to 10 hit/dam, -150 ac and I have spent 9 points.
Now I will add + 50 HP for 1 point. Another for 2 more, another for 3 more, and another for 4 more.
Now i have 10 hit/dam -150 ac, +200 hp, and I have spent 19 points.
For the last point I will add +50 mana.
``
If you end up with one extra point it can be used to add an attribute.
Attributes are Dex, Str, Con, Cha, Wis, Int.

# enchanter~
`fZuru, a great mage of Exodus founded this profession.  Zuru grew up and
went to school with Zyrin, the head of the crescent moon school.  While just
as great of a mage, he aspired to learn a different angle of the magicks
rather than being satisfied with the knowledge he already possessed.  Zuru
developed a deep passion for enchantments.  The mystical and mysterious
aspects of it thrilled his every bone.  So he delved deeper into the art and
was soon able to comprise his own techniques.  Casting aside a few spells
and skills he learned at the school, he picked up an entirely new form of
the Mage profession.  He soon became somewhat obsessed with engineering new
enchantments and is now slightly mad.  However, he has recently decided to
return to the School to become a professor of Enchantment.  Zuru will make
sure his pupils learn the basic Magi survival, defense.  And offensive
skills, but will be unable to teach everything the Magi can learn from
Zyrin.  Along with this he greatly looks forward to bestowing his knowledge
of Enchantments, Runic inscribing, and Imbuing to any pupil who may aspire
to learn such.  He does however, request that anyone who wants to take his
class first take Zyrin's all the way through as a prerequisite.

# soul gems~

============================================================================
Soul Gems
============================================================================
As every Crescent Moon acolyte knows, magic  is to be  found  everywhere in
Exodus. While it  is usually possible to predict what form and expression 
magic will take, it sometimes can have unexpected outcomes.
`n
When a very  powerful being is  slain, a  great deal  of  magical  energy is
released.  Most  of the time, this energy is  given off so  efficiently that
even  people right beside the  freshly corpsed creature will not even notice
what has just happened.                                                     
`n   
Occasionally, however, the  magical  energy  is trapped as it tries to leave
the body, and it instantly crystalizes  into the form of a small gem.  These
soul gems are weightless: it would  be entirely possible to carry thousands,
if one wished, with no more burden or encumberance than a thousand grains of
sand.                                                                      
`n  
Each soul gem is unique, reflecting the essence of the being which  died to
give it shape.  Because  of the  rarity of  these gems, they are  emanantly
collectible and people in lands all over Exodus have been known to trade them
back and forth until they get as  perfect and  complete a  set as possible.
Avariel in particular is said to be a fanatic collector,  and it's rumoured
that she  will trade  interesting objects for unique sets of ten or more
gems.  Unlike  most quests,  this one  is completely  player-run, and takes
place at the player's leisure.
`n 
Avariel will also hand out free bags to keep soul gems in, if asked nicely.

`c        People do stupid things all the time. But
`c    On occasion, they do something SO stupid, that it
`c Just needs to be documented. Welcome to that hall of fame.
`n--------------------------------------------------------------
`n
1.`c Leon killed a level 20-something avatar in Fulk Nerra attempting to
intall a trap as a bard.

2.`c Oswald suggested to a level 90 avatar who said they had nothing left 
to do, "Why dont you remort again, then you'll be second gen."
`n
3.`c Avariel used the wrong vnums for an invention mix and ended up resetting
the knights in thesden to pop helmets on their arms.

how to purge a vnum without editing the raw code.

# role play~
``
Exodus does not force role play. You may speak openly on
[OOC] about anything you wish. Furthermore, if you're a 
child, you should leave now. Language, and sexually explicit 
conversations are not prohibited.
``
On the other hand, we have began offering very interesting 
rewards for people who DO choose to role play. So let's go
over a brief description of what is considered good role 
play and what sort of prizes you will receive for doing it.
``
A decent role player will present a persona that fits 
his race or class, he may speak over OOC but stay 
completely IC on other channels
``
A good role player will use OOC sparingly, create a 
brand new personality for his charactor, and present it
quite well.
``
A fantastic role player will never use OOC, and will 
determinitely, and continuously present himself as 
his charactor as opposed to his actual self. 
``
`j* `hDecent role play might get you one or two role playing points a week.
`j* `hGood role play will get you at least 5 role playing points a week
`j*`h Fantastic role playing will earn you 10 role playing points a week at the very minimum.
``
``Prizes available to only fantastic role players:`h
`h
`n* `hThe Kalian remort
`n* `hHero status
`n* `hFantastic role play is also a good place to start if you 
  wish to someday achieve the role play immortal spot.
``
Role playing points are simply our way of thanking you
for role playing. Here is a list of thinks you can redeem 
using them:

# multiplay~
MULTIPLAY
``
Multiplay is defined as a single real-life player who uses one Exodus character
to assist another Exodus character either directly or indirectly.  Multiplay
is not allowed on Exodus.  Multiplay includes, but is not limited to the
following:
``
*     Having more than one character logged on at the same time.
*     Having one character linkdead and another character logged on.
*     Passing equipment from one character to another character.
*     Dropping equipment in order to pass it between characters.
*     Giving equipment to a third party to pass it between characters.
*     Using a shop to transfer equipment between characters.
``
Transferring ownership of a character from one real-life player to another
is no longer permitted for any reason whatsoever.  Sharing passwords is
strictly prohibited and has caused HUGE problems in the past.

Clive is an aspiring MUD admin who has started a number of MUDs in the

``
If Clive invites you to check out his new MUD, be sure that you don't
use the same password as your Exodus character.  In the past, Clive
has logged peoples' passwords, then used them to hijack Exodus
characters and even delete them.  What an ass!
``
Clive occasionally talks his way into building priveledges, which he
promptly abuses.  All the imms have pretty much been burned enough

`o
         Hell night was created to let players really let lose. 
         On a hell night, a copy of the mud is made and ran on
         a separate port. On the mirror port, no current alts
         are affected by the changes they will undergo. Hell 
         Nights are always full PK, meaning that no one is safe
         from being killed by another player. If you play an
         Avatar, you may use it on Hell Night, if you die you
         do NOT lose your Avatar. However, the immortal will
         most likely NOT want to restore your Avatar, as for 
         you to continue to play it on a Hell Night. They will
         have a lot of other things going on, and will not have
         time to do something like this. So it is suggested that
         you not use an Avatar on Hell Night.
`o
`o
         On Hell Night, all wishes are granted. But you do not 
         get to keep anything you recieve for free. The immortal
         running Hell Night may or may not wish to also run quests
         which will allow you to recieve benefits that will roll 
         over onto the active Exodus Port. All quests will and MUST
         be altered in a way that will still post a challenge for
         the players involved, since they will have unlimited access
         to item editing's and enhancements. Immortals may also chose
         to run quests, and not have the benefits roll over. If you
         participate in a quest on Hell Night and get a prize, but 
         the prize is not awarded to your standard alt on the live
         port of Exodus, please do not whine about it unless you 
         were told explicitly that the prize would be awarded to 
         your live alt. Doing such things will result in punishment.
`o
         If you ask an Immortal running Hell Night for any item in 
         the world, they must oblige. If asked, the Immortal hosting
         Hell Night will also boost your Hit Points, Moves, and Mana.
         They may or may NOT agree to edit an item for you. It will
         depend solely on how busy they are.

# bacon~
`bBACON``
``
`bOK, so we always kind of knew it, but I couldn't help but wonder if it ``
`bwas a panacea or placebo effect, where we simply PSYCHED ourselves into ``
`bthinking that the hang-over was going away, simply because we were now ``
`bfocusing all of our attention on enjoying the greatest thing in the ``
`bentire world, BACON!``
``
`bWell, here's the scientific proof we were looking for. In Britain, where ``
`bbacon eating is more of a religion that dietary preference, so they tend ``
`bto know a bit about it, they have discovered the "Actual Factuals" about``
`bbacon curing Hangovers!``
``
`bAccording to Dr. Elin Roberts, "Science Development Manager" at the ``
`b"Centre for Life," a prestigious medical research institute in Newcastle, ``
`bEngland, this is exactly why Bacon with some eggs & toast is your perfect ``
`bhangover solution.``
``
`bDr. Roberts explains: "Food doesn't soak up the alcohol, but it does ``
`bincrease your metabolism - helping you to deal with the after-effects of ``
`bover-indulgence." "So food will often help you feel better. Bread is high ``
`bin carbohydrates and bacon is full of protein, which breaks down into ``
`bamino acids."``

# builder application~
`hSo you'd like to build on Exodus?  Great!  Building an area is something that`a
`hcrosses everyone's mind at some point.  The trick is to figure out whether`a
`hit's a whim or a real passion.  We see players as our guests and customers.`a
`hPlayers are the reason we run this mud.  We look at builders as our`a
`hemployees and we expect a level of performance out of them.  We have a`a
`hspecial port for building, which is seperate from the live port that people`a
`hplay on.  The builder's port is a lonely place unless you are busy working`a
`hon an area, so if you just want a character to hang out, you will be very`a
`hunimpressed.  Also, we need someone who we know and trust, so you have to`a
`hhave played this game for a while and built up a trust with the imms.  I`a
`hcannot tell you how many people have walked into Exodus and asked if we're`a
`hhiring builders.  The first question I always ask is "Have you played here?"`a
`hIf you have not played on Exodus, how can you understand the theme of the`a
`hgame and what kind of an area would be appropriate?  Also, you need to be a`a
`hliterate speller and have decent grammar.  We don't expect everyone to hold`a
`han English degree, but Exodus prides itself in the richness of its`a
`hdescriptions and we would like to keep up a standard.  Exodus has a great`a
`hOLC, but there is still a teaching process involved and we don't want to waste`a
`hour time teaching someone who will build for a week and then give it up.`a
`hLastly and most importantly, we need to know you actually plan to build an`a
`harea and not just study the game for your mortal alts on the live port.`a
`hYou may laugh, but people have done this in the past and it amounts to`a
`hcheating.`a
`a
`hIn order to be set up with an account on the builder's port, we need you to`a
`hdo a little homework first.  Here's what we need you to have for us when we`a
`hstart and remember that having this will help you when you start to build:`a
`k--`hWe will need a half-page description of the area you would like to`a
`hbuild.  Here is your chance to shine.  Impress us with the story behind`a
`hthe place you want to add.  Tell us about the people in it and the`a
`hconflicts and events.  You don't need to be technical here, just let us`a
`hknow that you have thought out a good well-rounded area.`a
`k--`hPrepare a general map of the area.  If you'd like to draw out every single`a
`hroom, that's great.  If you only have a simple sketch of the layout, that's`a
`hfine too.  If it's on a sheet of paper, see if you can scan it and email it`a
`hto us or post it on a website and send us the link.`a
`k--`hWrite out at least five room descriptions.  We want to know what it will`a
`hfeel like to walk through your area.`a
`k--`hWrite out at least three monster descriptions.  Pick your favorite mobs`a
`hand really give them some depth.`a
`k--`hFigure out how many rooms you will need.  This is another reason having`a
`ha map is a good thing.  You dont need to be exact, but be as close as`a
`hpossible.`a

If you have done all of this and you still want to build, then contact Duiwel
`hand we will talk about it.  Remember, if it's not fun, then there's no point.``

			    `f[`hThe Druid Guild`f]``
Druids are a blended class which has good capability in both melee and magic.
Inextricably connected to nature,  druidic magic reflects  the many strengths
found in the natural world: they can harness both the nurturing essence which
flows through all living things, and the terrible forces of destruction. They
can also grant both blessings and curses, depending on their need.  Even with
all these fine gifts, the most unique and important element of a druid is the
ability to summon an animal companion from the wild to aid his cause.

# monk~
`hRumors have reached civilization, telling stories about the peaceful and
patient monks who live secluded in a mountain village.  So one day, when, for
some unknown reason, the monks started to travel the realms.  People greeted
the monks with open arms, just to get their noses punched in.  It would seem
monks were not as calm as expected, quite the opposite.  Brawling took on a
whole new meaning as one monk easily defeated a whole crowd of mean drunks
with just the use of his hands and feet.  People now approach monks with
their swords unsheathed and their shields ready.

# enchanted forest~
`cArea: Enchanted Forest                        Continent: Starting 
`j====================================================================
`cThe Enchanted Forest's whereabouts are unknown in this world. No one 
has  been able to pin point the forest's exact location.  There have 
been rumors that it lies somewhere south-west of the Forest Fierense, 
but any traveler who has ever ventured to seek it, seemed to reach a 
dead  end of thick  bushes that they couldn't make their way through. 
It is from this that the Enchanted Forest draws it's name. Years ago
when new adventurers from all over the realm began to migrate to the 
forests around the city of Thesden to practice their fighting skills 
or to get a quick meal,  a powerful  Druid now known to the world as
Padfoot, bestowed  a strong enchantment over his precious forest, so 
that  any mortal seeking to destroy  would never find their way into 
its lush canopies.  However, if one should wish to help protect this 
land, there is one way to get into the forest. One must seek out the 
forest master,  tell her of their  wishes,  and they will be granted
access. 
``
`cThe Enchanted  Forest is filled  with mystical wonders,  and a new 
adventure is to be found around each corner. Nothing in the forest 
will harm you,  it is a peaceful,  magical place that has thrived 
through the years by segregating itself from the world.

# weapon flag~
``
So, this help file has been long overdue. I have spent some
time today and have found all the special weapon flags that
there are, and here are their values: 
``
1    - Flaming
2    - Frost
4    - Vampiric
8    - Sharp
16   - Vorpal
32   - Two handed
64   - Shocking
128  - Poison
256  - Lance
512  - Throwing
1024 - Apathy
4096 - Larva
2048 - Windslash
8192 - Holy
``
These are the values for each SINGLE weapon flag. If you don't
know how to add multiple ones using this table, or for the sake
of new immortals, here is how to do it:
``
Think of each numerical value as the individuals flags 'ID'. So
if Holy is 8192, and Larva is 4096, and you want a weapon to have
(for some reason) Holy and Larva, you add them together. So 8192 
+ 4096 = 12288, so the adjusted value for a weapon that is flagged
as holy larva, is 1228. If you wanted to add another flag, say sharp,
you add the value of sharp (8) onto the value of holy larva (1288), 
the adjusted value is 12296, thus making 12296 = holy larva sharp.

LOOTING
``
This is a way to steal an opponents equipment, LOOTING is only allowed
between playerkillers.  NoPK players are not allowed to take part in
LOOTING another players corpse.
``
LOOTING is defined as: The removal of eq from the corpse, or ground from a
recently butchered corpse of another player.
``
Some monsters in Exodus loot as well.  It's important not to confuse looting
mobs with scavenger mobs.  Scavenger mobs will pick up items that lie on the
ground.  Scavenger mobs generally do not wear the items they pick up.  If a
looting mob kills you, it will take everything from your corpse and attempt
to wear everything.  If the mob did not kill you, it will not loot you.
``
EXAMPLE:
Yorl was a NoPK character.  Yorl was killing in Krathen.  He got killed by
a Krathen Flag Guard, which is a looting mob.  Yorl was looted by the flag
guard.  The flag guard is also a hunting mob, so it hunted room by room to
try to find Yorl to attack him, even though Yorl was back in Thesden at the
altar.  During the course of hunting for Yorl, the flag guard entered a
player room which was attached to Krathen.  On the tick, the mob "wandered
on home" with all of Yorl's equipment.  This is fantastically bad luck,
akin to having an avatar get poisoned and then having the poison kill the
avatar five seconds later.  This is also a natural part of gameplay, and
therefore does not qualify for reimbursement or immortal intervention.
``
The following variations would have been illegal since Yorl was NoPK:
* A player kills the mob and then loots the equipment.
* A player teleports the mob out of the area to make Yorl lose his eq.
* A player charms the mob and keeps it away from Yorl.
* Any other player action that prevents Yorl from getting his gear.
`h
`kNote by Avariel: 6/25/2012
`h
No, this is NOT a natural part of gameplay. This is a blatant immortal 
fuck-up and everyone either A) Didn't want to deal with restoring Yorl 
or B) Didn't give a fuck because, well, it's Yorl.
`h
The following is a list of reasons why Yorl deserved reimbursement:
1. The player room should have had a door. As is standard.
2. The mob should have been flagged stay_area.
3. No mobs should be able to wanter into any player room. 
I can think of a hundred reasons why. This being one.
`h
It is situations like this that define us as immortals. There is a tiny
dot of a line that we have to tread between sympathetic and hard-ass. 
And this by-and-far is a case where the imms should have been sympathetic. 
For all the reasons listed above, this case was not only bad luck but 
purely unfar to a player of our game. I cannot stand that this helpfile 
even esists because it gives new players a bad impression of how much we 
value them.
`h
I will leave it up, however, as a testament to how shitty some of the 
previous immortals were. Under the new regime you will not have to worry 
about mobiles bugging-out and disappearing with all of your hard-earned gear.
`h
The pure audacity of calling this a natural part of gameplay enrages me. ``

# forsaken~
`a/`h/`o/ `iHistory:`a
`a
Members  of this  clan were once forsaken as young  by their friends
and  families.  Their beliefs  differred from the  society they were 
living in.  Banished  from their  homes,  with nothing  but  despair 
they hid in the sewers.  After meeting others like them,  they began 
to depend on eachother for their survival. Combining their knowledge 
and great strength they began to develop  a new form of combat. Time 
passed  and they gathered the  courage  to reveal their existence to 
the world. With nearly non-existant  knowledge about the world above 
ground they were laughed at,  but it came to an end when  they would
declare war on Thesden and anyone that dared to oppose them. The war 
ended very quickly,  Thesden had fallen and the clans  with it.  The 
new rulers of Thesden called themselves the Forsaken After the great 
victory they  vanished from the face of the  earth never  to be seen 
again and only to be spoken of in legends.
`h
Now once again they have returned to the realms of Exodus in numbers
and strength greater than ever.  Following them now, a contingent of 
exiles fully  trained in the art of destruction.  The Forsaken shall 
rise again....``
`a
`a/`h/`o/ `iRoleplaying:``
`a
We ask that  members of  Forsaken  uphold our general theme by being 
somewhat  calloused to affairs that  don't directly concern our clan 
as well  as having some sort of RP  plan that fits  in well with the 
clan's Roleplay and history.
`a
`a/`h/`o/ `iOOC Requirements:``
`a
- You HAVE to be an experienced character.
- You HAVE to be level 90.
- You HAVE to know how to pkill well.
- Your clan MUST come first.
- Your honor is the clans honor.``
`a
`a/`h/`o/ `iJoining Forsaken:``
`h
The easiest way to  join Forsaken  is to announce  that you  wish to join
via an RP note by  level 20, and spend the rest of your training publicly
seeking the clan. This shows loyalty  and dedication to the Forsaken, and
those who take this path will rarely be denied access. Given they  pass a
test.
`a
We  generally do not  accept people who have already been  in a different 
clan  and  defect  to join Forsaken.  It  shows  disloyalty  to your clan. 
However,  we of all  people understand what  it  means to be  shunned, so 
in special  cases,  we will  allow those  who were KICKED from their clan,
so long as they role play the incedent well.  The player will be required
to 'seek' Forsaken for at least a week prior to being actually considered.
`h
All applicants must pass a 3 stage test which will help us get a feel for
how  experienced the player  is with PK and general movement  in the game.
These tests are not rigorous and are mostly considered stupidity checks.``

# getting started~
`g+--------------------- `hGetting Started `g---------------------+``
`h
The tutorial will teach you most everything you need to know
about  starting the game, so this  is just a quick reference 
list.
`h
`kLOOK:
`hTyping `kLOOK`h will show you the room you are standing in. This
is a very basic command and one should be the most comfortable
with. 
`h
While in the tutorial, if people are chatting on OOC and make
the text disappear, you can type LOOK to view it again. 
`h
`kWHO:
`hTyping WHO will show you who is currently playing the game. 
`h
`kMOVING:
`hThere are 6 basic directions: North, South, East, West, Up, 
and Down. You can move in any direction by typing the first
letter of each, ie: n, s, e, w, u, and d.
`h
`kEQ:`h
You start with some basic gear which will quickly be replaced
once you get to the Arena part of the tutorial. View what you
are wearing by typing EQ and what is in your inventory by 
typing I.
`h
`kAsking for help:`h
Asking for help is IMPORTANT and ENCOURAGED. We can really 
only cover so much with a tutorial, as there is SO much to the 
game. Ask for help over public channels like OOC.
`h
IE: `koo I need some help with this part of the tutorial. `h
or
IE:`k oo I'm done with the tutorial but I need help with X.`h
`h
If you're playing a roleplay only character, you can use the
GOSSIP channel to ask public questions.
`h
IE: `kgossip I require assistence with this part of my training.`h
or
IE: `kgossip I have finished training but I find myself confused.`h
`h
`kCLIENTS:`h
Some clients are better than others. We recommend GMUD to start
with because it's the easiest to use when first connecting.
`h
It does have its flaws. If something scrolls off the screen, 
you can just manually scroll up by clicking and dragging your 
scroll bar.
`h
Once you feel you can handle a more complex client, ask over
OOC if someone has a copy of `kZMUD`h to share - most of us do.
`h
`kMOST IMPORTANTLY:`h
Have FUN with the tutorial and don't forget to ask for help
if you need it!``
~

# restring~
``Restring
``
Restringing is when an immortal changes the appearance of an item.
This service costs`k 1000 gold``.
``
`bBefore you ask an immortal for a restring, you should have figured``
`bout three things:``
The short description for the item,
the long description for the item,
and the keywords for the item.
``
This is an example of a short description:
`oa`a d`ho`ag`o collar``
(short descriptions should always start with a lower case(small letter) letter,
and never end with a period)
``
This is an example of a long description: 
`oA collar from the neck of a`a d`ho`ag`o has been discarded here...``
(long dascriptions should always start with an upper case(big letter) letter,
and always end with a period)
``
This is an example of keywords:
collar, dog
``
`bIf you want color on your restring, read this:``
It is much easier for the immortal if the player who wants the restring
tells the immortal the color codes too. Instead of just saying what the
finished restring should look like.
(for more details on color, see:`o help color``)
``
There is no horror greater than seeing a player say this:
MrNewb says 'can u restring this??'
MrNewb says '`ma`l s`ou`ip`rah p`ko`jww`her `qfliyng`e s`xword`n w`oith`r green`f s`ut`cr`di`sp`je`ks`x!!!!`a'``
``
To write out the color codes, so that the immortal can just copy and paste,
you do like this: You put a`i Z`` behind every `Z.
That makes '`ka `jp`yr`jo`yp`je`yl`jl`ye`jr`k cap``'
look like this: '`Zka `Zjp`Zyr`Zjo`Zyp`Zje`Zyl`Zjl`Zye`Zjr`Zk cap`Z`Z'
``
The last `Z`Z is important, it will prevent color bleeding of the item.
If you submit your restring with complete color coding, the price will
be`k 900 gold``.
~

# relics~
`g---------------------------- `kRelics `g-------------------------------
`h
A relic is an item that you earn here on Exodus through exceptional 
role play and character development. It is  similar to the SQI 
(Super Quest Item) which is earned by either questing or grinding 
for tokens. See help quest token and help sqi.
`h
There are some key differences between an SQI and a relic, though 
the general idea is still the same: A powerful, unique-to-you item 
earned through hard work and dedication.
`h
`kHere are the main differences:
`h
- A relic starts out with 7 points as opposed to 5.
- A relic will never have rot_death on it. 
- A relic must have an RP name suiting to your character.
- A relic must have a story behind it. (More on this later)
- A relic CAN be improved upon with continued exceptional RP.
`h
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`kHow do you earn a relic?
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`h
Start out with unfaltering roleplay. It is kosher to leave character 
once in a while, or even partake in a lengthy OOC discussion. 
However, going OOC on IC channels (Gossip, say, etcetera) isn't a 
great way to earn your relic.
`h
You're expected to have a strong RP background. A well  written 
history and description is a must. Those things alone will not only 
earn you smaller prizes respectively, but are the cornerstone of 
earning your relic.
`h
If you're aiming for a relic, you should probably think of an item 
that your character would have with them all the time. It can be 
anything - a mother's handkerchef, a blade of some sort - so long 
as it fits into your roleplay. We expect you to know what the item 
is going to be by the time we tell you that we feel you're ready for 
a relic. If you don't already  know, we'll ask you to take some more 
time and think about it. A couple short paragraphs on how your 
character acquired the relic are also required, if they aren't 
already written into your history.
`h
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`kSo how long will it take you to earn one?
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`h
In addition to your history, plan, and the explanation of where your 
relic came from, we are looking for a player who is dedicated to 
their character's role. We will be checking to make sure people are 
staying in character. A person with a relic is meant to set an 
example for other roleplayers, so these won't be  given out lightly. 
It could take you as short as a month or  as long as a year, 
depending on how long it takes you to develop your character and how
strong your roleplaying skills are.
`h
Once we decide that you are ready for a relic, the immortal staff
will hold a meeting to make sure we're all on the same page, and 
then we will be asking around to other players on whether or not
THEY feel like you've brought exceptional roleplay to the game.
`h
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`kRelics grow with you?
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------
`h
Yes! Relics are unique in that they can change and gain in power
over time as your character changes and gains in power. It will
start out as a regular SQI, and after a minimum 2 month grace period, 
can have the stats changed to suit your taste as long as there is an
RP reason backing the change.
`h
In addition, spells and affects and so much more can be added to 
your relic as a reward for ongoing (and outstanding) roleplay, so 
long as the additions are also backed up by your character's role.
`h
`h
`i** `gRelics were introduced to Exodus in August of 2012 by `nAvariel`g.
`h
`iSee also: `ghelp relic specs, help roleplay, help sqi, help description
help history, help relic growth

# description~
`h
Descriptions are what other people see when they look at you. A well written
description is important, as it gives other players an idea of the person 
they are role playing with. Well written descriptions can not only help you
earn your relic, but can earn you prizes as well. 
`h
To write your description, simply type DESC, and you will be taken to the 
exodus editor which should be self explanatory.
`h
Here is a list of the prizes you can earn, as reference to help you know
where your description is rated in the eyes of the immortals.
`h
On a scale of 1 - 10:
`h
1: A slay for wasting our time. A description rated with a 1 would have to
be openly laughable. A purposeful attempt to piss us off.
2: 200 gold.
4: 1000 gold.
6: one quest token
8: one restring token + 1000 gold
10: R + R (restring + relocate) token, + 2000 gold.
`h
`h
`kHere is an example of a description that would be considered a 10:
`g
==========================================================================
`a
The woman before you is tall, graceful and lean. `dPale yellow`a skin glimmers
softly, creating an aura of shimmering gold hues around her body. Deep red
and  black hair flows like `bmolten lava`a  down her back to come to an abrupt
stop just short of her waist, cutting off in a clean line.
`a
Eyes the shape of perfect ovals shine softly from behind a few rogue locks
of the silken ebony. They are the stunning red of `igl`bit`ite`bri`ing`a rubies, lined
with a thin band of black to form a perfect circle around the iris. Golden
flakes `bsp`ke`bck`kl`be`a  the blood-red pools, and  are constantly flickering in and
and out of view, only adding to the glittering illusion.
`a
Her face is slightly rounded and comes to a sharp point at her chin, which 
compliments the sharper point of her ears. Her lips are the soft, deep red
of a `brose petal`a, reflecting  the fiery blaze  of her eyes. High cheekbones
slant  delicately toward a long, thin  nose. Her  facial expression ranges
from apathy to smug amusement.
`a
From  her back emerge glorious  and mesmerizing `gcobalt-blue`a feathery wings
which `gir`bid`fes`gce`bnt`fly`a shine with purple and red hues.  Each wing is the shape
of a perfect tear drop, and each feather a slightly different hue from the
next. Magnificently sized, the tops of each wing begin just above her neck
and end at her shins in a soft, delicate point.
`a
On her legs, she wears flowing black `hsi`alk`hen`a pants that are just shy of see
through.  They are  tied securely at  the waist with a golden rope of soft
velvet and billow lazily down to her feet. Her chest is tastefully covered
with a long piece of the same black silk and tied at her back, leaving the
ends to fall about her waist.
`a
Small  splatters of `bblood`a on her  shoulders and mid-drift mark a deep love
for battle, and dirt covered toes which peak out from worn leather sandals
are the mark of a deep love for adventure.
`g
==========================================================================
`h
Not all descriptions rated a 10 will have to be so verbose. Remember that 
verbosity is not necessarily what we're looking for. We're looking for a
description that gives us a clear image of who we are looking at. Use your
words carefully, don't try to use big words because they sound cool unless
you are 100% sure what they mean. It's better to use small words well than
big words wrong.
`h
`iYOU WILL ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO GET A PRIZE.`h There are NO do-overs. Once 
you are ready for an immortal to check out your description, ask over OOC
if you can have you description evaluated. Be absolutely sure you're ready.
``

# channel abuse~
USE OF CHANNELS

The systems of communication are broken up into two categories: public and
private.  Public channels include Info, Question and Answer, OOC, Gossip,
Music, Yell, Shout, and Clan War.  Private channels include Tell, Clan Talk,
and Group Talk.  Your comments are welcome on any channel you can use as
long as they are within certain guidelines.  Immbashing is not allowed on
public channels.  Additionally, any private conversation held between you
and an Immortal may not be repeated on a public channel unless you are
given permission to do so by an Immortal Staff member.

Immortals take the time out of their real life day to work on Exodus without
getting paid for it.  As such, they are not to be openly criticized on
public channels.  You may say whatever you would like to those you know on
Exodus regarding your feelings about the immortals as long as it is done in
private notes or through the use of 'tells'.  The channels are available for
role-play, clan matters, questions and constructive comments about game play
and other non-personal matters.  If you abuse the privilege of using public
channels, you may be warned regarding this behavior and may have your
channel privileges taken away and/or be frozen, denied or deleted depending
on a variety of circumstances.

Additional ways to abuse your channel privileges include: using vulgar, foul
or offensive language over public channels, or spamming, which is repeating
the same thing over and over again.  Those on the Immortal Staff will be the
judge as to what is vulgar and offensive, however, they will also take what
is said in context from a role-play standpoint.
~

# best descriptions~
The following is a list of characters who have scored a 10 for their description,
earning them a variety of prizes depending on quality.
`h
We encourage you to seek these players out and ask them questions about their process,
how long it took them, and obviously, read their description.

`kQuick Points:

`k*`h It's not okay to use acronyms while in character.

        IE: lol, brb, ok (use Okay), etc.

`k*`h Don't go OOC with someone unless you ask them first, and only do it in
  tells.

   IE: tell Avariel (May I go OOC?) - Parenthesis generally denote OOC.

        - If they don't respond, your answer is 'No.' Remember, EVERY
          channel is considered RP unless an OOC agreement has been
          established. Don't assume GT's are OOC unless you've asked
          first. Says, Gossip, Clan Talk, and emotes should ALWAYS be IC.

`k*`h It's not okay to use terms like Stats, HP/MANA, Leveling, AC, etcetera.

   `fExamples`h:

    `iX`h What stats are best for a mage?
    `n*`h As a magic user, will I need to be overly charismatic?
                
    `iX`h How much mana do you have?
    `n*`h Do you have a large pool of magical reserves?

    `iX`h Want to go leveling? I'm only level 30.
    `n*`h Would you like to go hunting with me? I'm only about a third
      of the way through my training.

    `iX`h My AC sucks, so I get hit a lot.
    `n*`h My armor isn't the best, so I'm easily hit.

`k*`h Do not force roleplay. This is probably the worst thing you can do.

    `fExamples`h:
     `iX`h emote slaps you and you cower in a corner.
     `n*`h emote slaps you and fixes you with an icy stare.
               
       Never take the control of someone's character away from them.
       A level 90 Kalian Reaver for instance, likely wouldn't 'cower'
       over anything. That's not for you to say. You do the action,
       NEVER, EVER, EVER the reaction.

`k*`h The gossip channel should be a tool for an RP character, not a go-to.

    `fExamples`h:
   `iX`h Oh, hi someone. It's nice to see you again.
    (Take it to tells or find them in game.)
    `n*`h Is anyone interested in hunting with me?

   There are exceptions to this rule. I've seen some pretty awesome RP
   go down on the gossip channel, and I've seen some RP that just doesn't
   belong there. In time, you will learn the difference. At the beginning,
   you should just stay away from it unless you NEED to ask a public
   question.

`k*`h Grammar and spelling is important. Yes, I'm going to go here. In the past,
  I've said that having poor spelling/grammar is the MUD analogue of having
  a severe speech impediment in real life. I was immediately countered with
  'Who are you to tell me my character doesn't!' - Okay, fair argument. Your
  character may have a speech impediment, fine. But think of how such a thing
  might be presented in a fantasy novel. Could you read a book if every other
  word was misspelled? Just keep that in mind.

All in all, RP is about taking on a completely different mindset. What that
is, is completely up to you and how you want your character to act. The best
way to get into it initially is to simply pretend you're in medieval times.
Be a child for a while, use your imagination. Anything that doesn't make
sense to someone who lived in a castle hundreds of years ago shouldn't make
sense to your character - grant me some lenience here with magic.
