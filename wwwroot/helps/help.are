-1 STORY~

(From the Historical Chronicles of Avery the Elder)
Forty years after the coronation of the first of the Athanmere line in Castle
Dunluce, just before the withdrawal of the last elves from civilised lands,
a promising young lad was born in Elwyn Crossing. His father was unknown, his
mother an outsider who died during childbirth.  The boy showed impressive
talents, and was taken in and raised by the Silver Crescent mage guild.
He rose to a position of power within the guild as a mere teenager,
as much based on his compelling speeches as his skill with the magical arts.
Many of the old guard were concerned about some of his ideas, however, and
they opposed his rise to power.

Those on the guild council above him started to disappear mysteriously,
and the others quickly fell in line behind Tallundyr Auvryon, eventually
electing him leader of the guild. It was at this time that he began
to argue with the Church, claiming their edicts were restricting his
experiments.

The young mage initiated a split with the church, claiming that the gods
were an invention and that the only true power was the power harnassed by
himself and others of his ilk. It was not for lust of power or self
aggrandisement that the mage's philosophy caused him voluntary exile
from his home.  Partly because of his magical strength that rivalled
immortality and also for his disdain of the gods themselves, he taught that
there were no gods, and that mortals, through the learning of magic,
could become gods themselves. The Church, never happy with losing disciples,
and furious that such blasphemy could be allowed, staged a full scale attack
on the guild, with the support of the king's knights. Many of the mages died,
others fled to the Church seeking amnesty, a few, however, escaped with
the heretic to found a new college of magic far from human lands.
Auvyron was forced to seek amnesty in the dwarven kingdoms to the south,
where humans and elves seldom travelled.

He continued his experiments, pulling and bending at the borders of reality.
For years, far longer than the life of an average man,  he worked at the top
of his tower until one day he pushed too far with his Greater Planar Magics,
forcing a rift to appear, opening entry points into worlds unknown.  The
surrounding lands were greatly changed, the Cataclysm shook the entire world
for a fortnight.

The civilised peoples thought that this was the work of the gods, infuriated
with the spread of this atheistic 'religion'.  The dwarves knew better.
The nexus was located not far from their mountain caverns, and they had seen
some of their kin torn apart by wandering too close to  this wizard's
creation; some wandered through never to appear again.  The wizard himself
disappeared, and it was widely rumoured among the dwarves that he had
either left to challenge the gods, or he had descended into hell itself.
Either way, the Council of Nine swore to keep this a secret from
the civilised lands, for they feared that the discovery of the nexus
would cause widespread chaos.

            All old-style players who log into Exodus 2.0 for the first
            time will not be compatible with the new system.  As a result,
            a conversion system has been created to get the old-style
            players into the new-style system.

            When you log in, you are moved to jail, but you are not being
            punished.  We just need to get you out of circulation.  You
            have all your equipment and all your public channels.  Also,
            you will have easy access to food and water this way.  If you
            want to stay under the old-style system and simply chat, you
            may do so.  Or, if you wish to speak with an immortal before
            going through conversion, you have that option as well.

            If you do go through conversion, you will receive a lump sum
            of experience for your old-style levels and skills.  The higher
            your various skills were, the more exp you get for each of them.

            The first thing to be aware of is that your stats have been
            rerolled.  If you do not like your stats, you can reroll over
            and over using the `kreroll`` command.  This command can only
            be used at level 1, so once you advance, you're stuck with
            your stats.

            Your character will automatically have every skill and spell/
            prayer/song/chant that your class can get at 1%.  There is no
            longer any need to pick and choose.  Practice points are gone
            and you will practice your skills by spending experience
            points.

            Training points are still here, although you can no longer
            train hp/mana/move.  It's ok, though, because you can improve
            them by spending exp as well, but you should not worry about
            that right now.  At level 1, you have two training points.
            Once you have a reroll that you like, spend you training points
            on your stats.  Now you're ready to advance.

            The cost of advancing rises steadily as you go up, so you should
            check your total exp after every level advancement.  For each of
            the first ten levels, you will get another training point to use
            on your stats.  Use them as you go so you can take advantage of
            their benefits right away.

            It's important to take care when building your character because
            if you spend too much exp on levels, you will not have as much
            to spend on skills and spells.  Likewise, you should not rush
            off and practice your skills and spells to 100% right away
            because the cost of practicing rises steadily as well.

            My suggestion would be to deal with advancing to level 10 first
            and spend your training sessions along the way.  Once you are
            at level 10, look at your skills and spells and start
            practicing them.  they all start off very cheap and they all
            end up very expensive.  Practice the ones you want to about 50%
            and then check your exp to make sure you have enough.  You can
            always top them off later.  After this, strike a balance
            between advancing levels and practicing skills and spells.
            You will notice that your final character will be nowhere near
            as powerful as you were under the old system.  It's ok though,
            because you will be more powerful than those who you were more
            powerful than under the old system and there is so much more
            possibility to grow now.

0 HERO~
`hA hero is a player who has transcended mortal limits through exceptional
roleplay and has been rewarded with an additional level that mortals
cannot attain on their own.  In this way, the hero stands on a level
between mortals and immortals.

`oHow are heroes like players?
`kHeroes are still players and are bound by all the rules of other players.
Heroes are encouraged to continue to interact with other players like normal.
Any PK rule that applies to a level 90 player also applies to a hero.
Heroes get ONLY the skills and spells that he or she had at level 90.
Heroes may be in clans and may even lead clans.

`oWhat makes heroes different?
`kHeroes are level 91.
Heroes never get hungry or thirsty.
Heroes have access to launch certain quests and events.
Heroes have more to lose if they are punished for breaking the rules.

`oHow do you become a hero?
`kImmortals decide on who is fit to be a candidate for hero.
A candidate must possess an exceptional history of good RP.
Hero candidates are confirmed or rejected by player vote.
After confirmation, a candidate must complete a Hero's Quest.
If all is completed to immortal satisfaction, the candidate becomes a hero.``
~

1 NECROMANCER~
`h
`aMasters of the darkest secrets and most frightening powers, necromancers`h
`aare mages who have chosen the path of evil for their studies.  Necromancers`h
`aare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand`h
`acombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer`h
`aand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between`h
`alife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to`h
`aanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. `h
`h
`aNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and`h
`arituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to`h
`aperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a`h
`afocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,`h
`ahexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects`h
`arespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer`h
`athey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the`h
`anecromancer's own blood to draw. `h
`h
`aUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which`h
`atype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are`h
`askeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a`h
`anatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.`h
`aWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come`h
`afrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always`h
`abeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a`h
`aplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains`h
`aand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that`h
`aphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some`h
`ainnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in`h
`acombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty`h
`aapparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark`h
`ahood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be`h
`aunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for`h
`aa lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies`h
`afrozen with fear.`h

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.  Not all locks can be picked.
~

0 COAX~
Syntax: coax <mount>

With proper coaxing, players can coax their mount to eat, drink, sleep, and
perform other life essential tasks.
~

-1 SCALE DESCEND JUMP CLIMB CRAWL ENTER EXIT LEAVE~

Fortunately, the players of Exodus have many more movement options open
to them than the traditional (east,west,north,south) exits.  Players
can scale mountains, descend a cliff, or jump from a tree (if they are dumb
enough to, that is). Other options are available, of course, depending on
the situation. What command is necessary will be indicated.
~

-1 DISMOUNT MOUNT MOUNTS MOUNTING~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

It is sometimes difficult for an adventurer to walk across the vast realms
of Exodus.  This problem can usually be alleviated by making use of the
mountable animals that exist throughout the land.  Many shops are available
for the purpose of trading in mountable animals, and there also exist stables
that allow you to board your animals, for a fee.  As you move around
while on a creature, only your mounted creature will become tired.  Mounted
creatures may not be taken everywhere, however, as the terrain you enter
may be unsuitable for their structure.

See also stable, tether, untether, tame.
~

-1 PUSH DRAG~

For when you're feeling especially forceful, you can push and drag
your opponents, be they mob or player. The successfulness of your
action depends on several things, such as strength, dexterity, relative
encumberance, and level.

SYNTAX:

push <character> <direction>

drag <character> <direction>
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 QUAD DOUBLE HALF~
Quadruple Experience, Double Experience, and Half Experience are modifications
the immortals can make to the amount of experience you get for killing monsters.
It is a gift from the Gods and does not happen very often, so you should enjoy
it when you have the chance.

`iASKING FOR QUAD OR DOUBLE IS CONSIDERED A GRAVE INSULT AND IS OFTEN MET WITH
PUNISHING RESULTS FROM THE GODS!``
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
When grouped, you will assist others in combat for a more effective fighting
force.  Experience gained when in a group is handled using the shares system.
Every member of the group gets a number of shares equal to his or her level.
When experience is earned, it is divided by the number of total shares in the
group.  In this way, a level 90 in the group will always get a larger share
of any kills than a level 1 will.

Example:  If a level 90, a level 10, and a level 1 are grouped, there are 101
shares in the group (90+10+1)  If the group kills a monster worth 13500 exp,
the 13500 points will be divided by 101 for a result of 133 exp per share.
The level 1 player has 1 share, so he would get 133 exp.
The level 10 player has 10 shares, so he would get 1330 exp.
The level 90 player has 90 shares, so he would get 11970 exp.

Groups of characters lead by a paladin skilled in leadership will generally
have boosted morale, that increases the group's chances of winning in battle.
If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

Because those of the Sidhe race are not comfortable with other races in the
realms of Exodus, they are unable to group with other races.

~

-1 GALLOP~
Syntax: gallop <directions>

Galloping allows you to move quickly in a series of specified directions
while riding on a mount.  The format for the directions should be one string
consisting of a letter for each direction you wish to travel.  For example,
typing 'gallop ssed' would cause you to ride your mount twice south, once
east and then down.  If your mount bangs into a door or wall while galloping,
it will stop its movement.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to the gods of Chaos for miraculous transportation where
you are put back in the Town Hall of Thesden.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

RECALL can only be invoked until you are level 10. Higher level players must
experiment in other antiquated forms of transportation.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE SIT~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: rest  <object>
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: sleep <object>
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: sit   <object>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

SIT allows you to sit on or in furniture. You can also rest or sleep
on some furniture. Note that some furniture or rooms may have modifiers
to regeneration rates.
~

0 BOAT SAIL SAILING ROW ROWING PADDLE PADDLING BOATS~
Syntax: sail <direction>
Syntax: row <direction>
Syntax: paddle <direction>


    The world of Exodus is covered by many different bodies of water ranging
from small streams to mighty oceans.  While swimming is sufficient to cross
some of these areas, the larger spans of water require boats for travel.
The easiest, though most expensive, way to procure a boat is through a boat
seller.  Boat sellers may be found in most port cities, near the water's
edge.  Once you buy your boat, the boat seller will supply you with a map
to the dock on which your boat can be found.  Once you arrive at your boat's
location, you may enter the boat and begin to move it around on the water.
The command used to move your boat depends upon the boat type -- boats that
use sails to harness the power of the wind use the 'sail' command to get
from place to place, while human-powered boats use the 'row' or 'paddle'
command.  As you move from place to place, you may take a look at the water
outside your boat by typing 'look out'.  Your boat will only be able to
travel in the water, and may even be restricted by the type and depth of the
water you are travelling in.  Most boats available in Exodus have keys that
limit access to the key holder.  If you dock your boat at a pier and deboard,
make sure you lock the entrance so that thieves do not make off with your
hard-earned transport.
~

-1 SCAN~

The command SCAN gives you an indication of the rooms surrounding you,
and dependent on the weather, rooms in the distance.

This command can be useful when searching for fleeing or aggressive mobiles.
~

0 STABLE RETRIEVE~
Syntax: stable <mount mobile name>
Syntax: retrieve <mount mobile name>

The stable command allows you to check your mount into the stable if you
are currently in a room that acts as one.  Mounts that are stored in
stables can be retrieved using the retrieve command, even if you quit the
game and come back later.  You may list mounts you have stabled in
the current stable by typing 'list.'  Note: You must retrieve your mount
in the same stable that you checked it in at.
It costs nothing to stable your mount, however, the cost of the stabling
of your mount will be deducted from the funds you are holding at the time
you retrieve your mount.  If you do not have enough money, you will not
be able to retrieve your mount.
~

-1 TETHER UNTETHER~
Syntax: tether <mount>
Syntax: untether <mount>

  There are many places in Exodus where the riding and use of mounts is either
frowned upon (such as in the finer shops) or not possible (such as on steep
mountain ranges).  Since you cannot take your mounts with you everywhere you
go, tethering allows you to tie your mount to an available stationary object
such as a rock or a tree.  While tethered your mount will not wander away and
leave you stranded.  You may untie your mount using the untether command.
Tethering your mobile is not completely safe, however, as unscrupulous
adventurers may find your mount, untether it and make off with it.
~

-1 TRANSPORTS~
Many different types of transportation exist to aid you in getting from place
to place within the realms of Exodus.  There are mounts that you may ride
through the land, water and air;  boats and rafts that you may use to cross
water; and wagons and primitive forms of mass transportation that can ferry
you across large  areas of land.  Not to mention the various magical forms
of transportation that are available.

See also [help boats] and [help mounts].
~

0 BATTLECRY~
Syntax: battlecry <new battlecry message>
Syntax: battlecry delete

The battlecry command allows you to set a message to be sent when you
initiate a fight.  The message you give as a battlecry is appended
to your character's name and sent to all in the room when the fight
begins.  You may delete a set battlecry by using the delete option.

Example:

> battlecry screams and attacks!

  When you attack mobiles or other players, all the characters in the room
  will see "<Yourname> screams and attacks!"
~

0 CAST PRAY~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
Syntax: pray <spell> <target>

Cast is for mages and rangers. Pray is for clerics and paladins.

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

If you abbreviate, you may end up casting the wrong spell. Be forewarned.

~

0 DAMAGE~
As you become more adept in your chosen field of training at Exodus, 
your skill with favored forms of attack will also increase.  As this 
skill, your level, and the quality of the vassal that you choose to 
unleash this attack with (say, a weapon) increase, so do the amounts 
of damage that you can inflict upon other inhabitants of the land. 
 
Adventurers who `amiss, barely touch, nick ``or `ascratch`` their foes may 
 
want to consider rethinking their careers. 
 
Should you `hhit, injure, ``or `hwound`` your opponent, your power is still 
low, but growing. 
 
A strike that `omauls, decimates, ``or `omaims`` is a sign of mediocre 
accomplishment. 
 
Adventurers a bit more skilled in their forms of attack, or those with 
great worldly gifts may find themselves `kMUTILATING, DISEMBOWELING, 
DISMEMBERING, MASSACRING,`` or `kMANGLING`` their unlucky challengers. 
 
Those well-trained in their arts of war will find it no surprise when 
their foe is `bDEMOLISHED`` or `bDEVASTATED``, and the truly supreme can 
cripple their adversaries by `bOBLITERATING, ANNIHILATING,`` or even 
`bERADICATING`` them with swift strikes. 
 
Very skilled questors may find themselves in a position 
to incapacitate their aggressors.  They typically `iDESTROY, PULVERIZE, 
do UNSPEAKABLE things to, LIQUIFY`` or `iVAPORIZE`` them, though this 
phenomenon is rare. 
 
The rarest form of damage is reserved for anomalous mortals or GODS 
who `ldo UNGODLY DAMAGE to`` their unfortunate opponents.

-1 DUEL ARENA~

There exists an arena here, shaped in legend and stone, where
heroes of pages past and future have aspired to etch their names
in the Book of Legends.

In the Arena, players can duel one another, within a ten level limit,
to the death without worry of loss of equipment or experience.
There is also a room where Spectators may go to watch and wager
on the fights.  In the Arena, all combatants are given an Arena issue
set of equipment with which the duel is rendered more equal.

When two characters agree to a duel, they are instantaneously transported
to the Arena for a duel to the death.  The winner receives a portion
of the proceeds from the sale of tickets.  The loser is transported
back to the Hall of Legends where perhaps he can try again to be made
Legend.

The Book of Legends records the Heroes who have distinguished themselves
with their remarkable skill.

SYNTAX:

duel: shows you the current duel information.
duel add: adds you to the public duel list.
duel withdraw: withdraws your current request for a duel.
duel <player>: sends a duel request to a player currently logged in.
duel cancel: may be used by immortals to cancel any duel.
~

0 'FIGHT LAG' LAG 'COMBAT LAG'~

Players recently in combat may find themselves unable to quit, delete
or concentrate enough to cast some powerful spells.  This is because
Exodus implements a fight lag system in which in the 120 second period
after a battle, your character might find itself too battle weary,
too frenzied, or too busy to do certain things.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, than fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.
~

0 KILL MURDER~
Syntax: kill <target>
Syntax: murder <target>

Kill and murder are the simple way to start a fight. Note that some mobs
remember you, and don't take kindly to being attacked. Murder is required
to attack other players.
~

0 PLAY~
Syntax: play <song name> <target>

	The play command allows bards to play a musical score, either
a general music score that may also be sung, or a composed musical
score, which must be played on an instrument.  Using play with general
musical scores increases the effectiveness of the magic they produce.
However, you do need an instrument to play the song, and the bonus given
is dependent upon the level of the instrument you use.
~

-1 SING SINGING SONG SONGS~
Syntax: sing <song name> [target]

   The sing command is the primary means by which bards harness magic.
As in real life, a bard must practice a song quite a bit before he or she can
master its full power.  The more you practice a song, the greater the chances
of you performing it correctly.  Singing songs costs mana, though the
cost of mana per song decreases as your level increases.  If the song name
is more than one word, you must quote the spell name.  Exampe:
sing 'Ballad of Ole Rip' Ragnar.  Quoting is optional for single-word songs.
You can abbreviate the song name as long as the abbreviation used is unique
to one song.

See also the help sections for individual songs, play and instruments.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

AFK also supports a message that can be displayed to people attempting
to send you tells: by typing 'AFK be right back', these players will
receive the message Player is AFK: be right back.
~

0 AUCTION BID~
Syntax: Auction
Syntax: Auction stats
Syntax: Auction <item name> <minimum bid>
Syntax: Auction bid <amount>

Typing Auction without parameters will toggle the auction channel on
and off.
Auction stats:  Shows you the stats of the current item being auctioned.
                You may not see the stats on your own item.
Auction <item>: Puts the item up for auction, if no other auctions are
                taking place. Adding a minimum bid sets the minimum above
                50 silver. Note that this is the ONLY time that the person
                auctioning the item can affect the price.
Auction bid <amount>: This places your bid on the item. You may not bid on
                      your own item.
Auction stop: Command used by immortal to stop an auction in progress.

You can auction using notation such as 10K, for 10000. All amounts are in
SILVER.  The minimum bid, unless otherwise set, is 50 silver.
~

-1 NOTE NOTES POETRY OOCNOTE RPNOTE NEWS PENALTY IDEA UNREAD~
The following options are available.

There are several bulletin boards on Exodus on which private and public
notes may be posted.  Below is a list of the boards currently available and
the purpose of the board.

       OOCNOTE     : Notes for Out Of Character notes (non-roleplay).
       RPNOTE      : Notes for Role-Play use only.
       POETRY      : Board for posting poetry and music.
       IDEA        : Board for posting ideas related to improving Exodus.
     * CHANGES     : Board for posting changes made to Exodus.
     * NEWS        : Board for posting announcements.
    ** PENALTY     : Board for informing immortals of rule-breaking.

    (*) = Boards that only Immortals may post to.
   (**) = Boards that only Immortals may post to and read.

To access the boards, whether it is with the purpose to read the notes posted
on them or to post a note, it is necessary to type the board name followed
by the appropriate command.  Shown below are commands used with the POETRY
board.  The same commands may be used on other boards by substituting
'Poetry' with the name of the board you wish to use.

reading notes:
Poetry list       : show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
Poetry read       : either by number, or read next to read unread notes
Poetry remove     : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
Poetry catchup    : marks all notes as read

writing new notes:
Poetry to         : sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
Poetry subject    : sets the subject for a new note
Poetry +          : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
Poetry -          : remove a line from a note in progress
Poetry clear      : erase a note in progress
Poetry show       : shows the note you are working on
Poetry post       : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

(PLEASE NOTE:  No notes may be posted to 'all' by characters who are below
               level 15.)

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
'<boardname> read' to scroll through them one at a time.

The 'unread' command can be used to show you if there are any notes addressed
to you, 'all' or your clan (when applicable) that have not been read by you.

See the 'help note boards' section of the posted rules for information
regarding the appropriate use of note boards.

Send to 'immortal' to reach the immortals. Send to 'admin' to reach the level
100 immortals. Abuse of these features will not be taken lightly.
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

0 DISBAND DEFECT SWAP~
Syntax: disband
Syntax: defect
Syntax: swap

Disband allows group leaders to immediately disband all members from their
group.  Defect allows non-leader group members to immediately leave
the group. Swap allows the group leader to pass leadership of the group on
to another player.
~

0 DESCRIPTION DESC~
`h
Descriptions are what other people see when they look at you. A well written
description is important, as it gives other players an idea of the person 
they are role playing with. Well written descriptions can not only help you
earn your relic, but can earn you prizes as well. 
`h
To write your description, simply type DESC, and you will be taken to the 
exodus editor which should be self explanatory.
`h
Here is a list of the prizes you can earn, as reference to help you know
where your description is rated in the eyes of the immortals.
`h
On a scale of 1 - 10:
`h
1: A slay for wasting our time. A description rated with a 1 would have to
   be openly laughable. A purposeful attempt to piss us off.
2: 200 gold.
4: 1000 gold.
6: one quest token
8: one restring token + 1000 gold
10: R + R (restring + relocate) token, + 2000 gold.
`h
`h
`kHere is an example of a description that would be considered a 10:
`g
==========================================================================
`a
The woman before you is tall, graceful and lean. `dPale yellow`a skin glimmers
softly, creating an aura of shimmering gold hues around her body. Deep red
and  black hair flows like `bmolten lava`a  down her back to come to an abrupt
stop just short of her waist, cutting off in a clean line.
`a
Eyes the shape of perfect ovals shine softly from behind a few rogue locks
of the silken ebony. They are the stunning red of `igl`bit`ite`bri`ing`a rubies, lined
with a thin band of black to form a perfect circle around the iris. Golden
flakes `bsp`ke`bck`kl`be`a  the blood-red pools, and  are constantly flickering in and
and out of view, only adding to the glittering illusion.
`a
Her face is slightly rounded and comes to a sharp point at her chin, which 
compliments the sharper point of her ears. Her lips are the soft, deep red
of a `brose petal`a, reflecting  the fiery blaze  of her eyes. High cheekbones
slant  delicately toward a long, thin  nose. Her  facial expression ranges
from apathy to smug amusement.
`a
From  her back emerge glorious  and mesmerizing `gcobalt-blue`a feathery wings
which `gir`bid`fes`gce`bnt`fly`a shine with purple and red hues.  Each wing is the shape
of a perfect tear drop, and each feather a slightly different hue from the
next. Magnificently sized, the tops of each wing begin just above her neck
and end at her shins in a soft, delicate point.
`a
On her legs, she wears flowing black `hsi`alk`hen`a pants that are just shy of see
through.  They are  tied securely at  the waist with a golden rope of soft
velvet and billow lazily down to her feet. Her chest is tastefully covered
with a long piece of the same black silk and tied at her back, leaving the
ends to fall about her waist.
`a
Small  splatters of `bblood`a on her  shoulders and mid-drift mark a deep love
for battle, and dirt covered toes which peak out from worn leather sandals
are the mark of a deep love for adventure.
`g
==========================================================================
`h
Not all descriptions rated a 10 will have to be so verbose. Remember that 
verbosity is not necessarily what we're looking for. We're looking for a
description that gives us a clear image of who we are looking at. Use your
words carefully, don't try to use big words because they sound cool unless
you are 100% sure what they mean. It's better to use small words well than
big words wrong.
`h
`iYOU WILL ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO GET A PRIZE.`h There are NO do-overs. Once 
you are ready for an immortal to check out your description, ask over OOC
if you can have you description evaluated. Be absolutely sure you're ready.

~

0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Derien will be read as bonks you by Derien, and
as bonks Derien by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

0 FINGER PLAN~
Syntax: finger <user>
Syntax: plan [delete]

FINGER shows you when a user last logged in, and any text that user has
entered using the PLAN command.

PLAN allows you to create, change or delete the information that will be
shown to users that FINGER you.
~

0 GTELL REPLY SAY TELL WHISPER SAYTO~
Syntax: gtell   <message>
Syntax: say     <message>
Syntax: tell    <character> <message>
Syntax: sayto   <character> <message>
Syntax: whisper <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

SAYTO sends a message to all awake players in your room, but it is directed
so everyone knows who you were talking to.

WHISPER sends a private message to someone else in the room.  Everyone else
sees that you whispered something to the player, but they don't see what
you whispered.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.  You may
stack character names in tells by enclosing a list in square brackets ([]),
separated by a comma.  For example:
tell [murk, cailet, damian] This is a GREAT mud!

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

TELL and REPLY do not work for sidhe characters, and do not reach them.
~

0 CHANNELS GOSSIP SHOUT YELL OOC INFO MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER GRATS RANT GEMOTE~
Syntax: answer   <message>

Syntax: yell     <message>
Syntax: grats    <message>
Syntax: rant     <message>
Syntax: gemote   <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP is a variant of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a synonym for
GOSSIP. GOSSIP is for IC only.

OOC is a variant of GOSSIP for Out of Character interataction.

RANT is an OOC channel reserved for trash talking, whining, and complaining. 
If you have to curse, taunt, bitch, or complain about how unfair the world
is, this is the channel to use.

GEMOTE is a way of doing a global emote.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

INFO is a channel for newbies, giving automated help at intervals. You
cannot talk on this channel.

MUSIC is the global outlet for the fair tunes of the bards. No other class
may use this channel.

QUESTION and ANSWER (Q/A for short) are for asking and answering questions.

GRATS is for congratulating people.

Sidhe can only use OOC channels. All other channels are considered in
character and since they cannot talk, they cannot use them.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and in pk situations will incur the
same penalties that you would have received had you made a kill without
followers present.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages you in combat your power over the creature
will have been broken.
~

0 QUIET~
Syntax: quiet

QUIET keeps you from being interrupted by anything except for says and emotes,
Useful for when you're busy.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects, so relying on
COMPARE without knowing an object's characteristics is not a fool-proof way
of determining the strength and/or durability of an object.
~

0 DISROBE HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: disrobe
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

DISROBE removes everything you are wearing. A synonym is REMOVE all.

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

1 CLAN~
Clans are groups of like-minded people who have united for the purpose of a
shared goal.  Depending on your race, guild, and alignment, you may qualify
for membership in a clan if you so desire, but you should know what you are
getting into.

Membership in a clan offers several important benefits.  Protection is one
such benefit.  You will have access to a clan hall and shelter from those
who may wish you ill.  You will also have a clan donation box, from where you
can take equipment to replace any you may have lost.  There is also a degree
of protection from aggressive monsters in the realms.  Your membership in
a clan will keep many less powerful monsters at bay while you pass.  Each
clan also has a private channel which is seen only by immortals and clanmates.

There are also inherent dangers associated with joining a clan.  First and
foremost is PK and the possibility of being looted.  When you join a clan,
you accept that you've entered a competitive association where differences
are sometimes settled at the end of a sword.  At any time, and especially
while at war, you should be aware of who may be looking for you.  This
cannot be stressed enough.  When you join a clan, you can be killed by
another player from that time forward.  You can leave the clan, but you
have forever forfeited your PK-protected status.

CLAN LIST will provide you with a list of existing clans.

HELP <clanname> will show you the philosophy and requirements for membership
in a given clan.

CLAN WHO <clanname> will show you who leads a given clan.  The leader and
the deputies of a clan can approve your membership, but it's up to each
clan to decide the rules for who gets in.

see also: HELP CLAN RP
~

1 'CLAN RP' 'CLAN ROLEPLAY'~
Clans are roleplay groups.  Depending on the rules of the clan, the degree
of required roleplay may be heavy or almost nonexistent, but seperation of
characters will be enforced by the immortal staff.

* In the simplest terms, knowledge and grudges are not shared between alts.
Switching alts to get revenge is always in poor taste and cannot be done
if it violates clan alliances and if there is no justifiable RP reason for
it.  If no acceptable justification can be given, it can be treated as
multiplay.  More leeway is given to loners than to clan members in this
matter.

* Intentionally dying to affect the course of a clan war, especially for
the benefit of another alt, is strictly prohibited and will be prosecuted
vigorously by the immortal staff.

* Using an alt to raid another clan's resources is also prohibited and if
the immortals catch anyone doing this, the punishment will be harsh.

If you cannot seperate your characters' personalities, then they should
not be in clans.  Players are also prohibited from having two or more alts
in leadership positions in different clans.  Pick one and let someone else
lead the other clan.  Imm-alts are discouraged from running clans so long
as there is a suitable player character who is willing and able to assume
the role.
~

0 DONATE CD 'CLAN DONATE'~
Syntax: donate      <item>
Syntax: cd          <item>
Syntax: clan donate <item>

DONATE sends an item to the donation box, so that the unfortunate may have
them.

CLAN DONATE (CD) sends the item to a clan donation box. Obviously, you must
be in a clan to do this.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.
You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists the equipment you are wearing (ex. armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists what is in your inventory.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 JUNK SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the gods of Chaos, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.  You will find
that not everything in Exodus is an acceptable sacrifice to the gods.
~

0 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of newbie gear courtsey of Thesden charity societies. Only empty
equipment slots are affected.
~

0 PACK UNPACK~
Syntax: pack <item> in <container>
Syntax: unpack <item> from <container>

Pack acts like put, except it allows you to put items in a container that
is carried by your mount.  For example, if you buy or find a 'girdle',
you may 'put girdle on horse' (Assuming 'horse' is a mobile that you have
tamed or mounted), then you may 'pack sword in girdle', and a sword that
you hold will be put into the girdle that the mount is wearing.  Unpack
works in the same way, but takes items from the girdle.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  Pets can be named at the
time they are purchased by typing the following:

buy <animal name> <the name you wish to name your pet>

Pets may not be named after existing players.

There are pet shops located all over the realms.
~

0 PRESS PULL~
Syntax: press <object>
Syntax: pull  <object>

For pressing buttons, pulling levers, and the like.
~

0 WRITING PEN PENCIL PAPER~
Although the most common form of communication on Exodus is speech,
other more archaic, but nevertheless useful types exist in the world.
Using a writing utensil and a piece of sturdy parchment or note paper,
messages can be scribed on these objects, and left behind for other
players, or given to them.

Some possible uses for written communications include clan initiations
or communications, player-run quests, or simply as a means to jot things
down permanently (regular notes are purged frequently), such as maps of
foreign lands, or directions to treasures, etc.
~

-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
~

-1 ANONYMOUS~

This toggled command hides your race, level, and class from others. It cannot
be used until level 30 (except for sidhe), and does not work against immortals
and people significantly higher level than you.
~

-1 AFFLUENCE DOMINION~
Syntax: areas

This command shows you a full list of all the areas on Exodus that you
can explore, and eventually conquer.

The format of the output is as follows:
[Suggested Levels for Exploration]
[The Name of the Area as given to it by its Forger]
[The Creator of the Area]
[$$ signifying Affluence, a numeric value that represents an area's value]
[Under which clan's dominion does this area belong]
[Related help files that will give you more information about each area]
~

0 COMMANDS REPORT SCORE TIME~
Syntax: commands
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

-1 COUNT~

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~

0 GLANCE~
Syntax: glance <character|mob>

The glance command can often be useful when fighting mobs or players,
because with glance, you can quickly obtain the condition of your target,
instead of having to be subjected to many lines of equipment spam.
~

-1 IMMORTALS GOD~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 92
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.
~

0 KILLCOUNT KC~
Syntax: kc
Syntax: kc <character>

This shows how many times the character has died, been pkilled, killed, and
pkilled. Note that if you kill yourself, you may rack up a pkill and a pkilled.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 60 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 90 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 VERSION~

Shows the version number and latest build date.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

-1 WHO~
Syntax: who
Syntax: who <level-range>
Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <clan name>
Syntax: who <class or race> <level-range> <clan name>

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.
For example:

who 10          lists all players of level 10 or above
who 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20
who cleric      lists all clerics playing
who immortal    lists all immortals playing
who cleric 1 5  lists all clerics between levels 1 and 5
who elf cleric  lists all elven clerics
who demagogue   lists all members of clan Demagogue that are on

Classes and races may be abbreviated.
~

-1 WHOIS~
Syntax: whois <name>
The whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For
example, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.
~

0 WORTH~
Syntax: worth

The worth command is a very useful utility that lets you quickly view
your tangible wealth, the total experience you have accumulated,
and how much experience is still required for you to attain your next level.
~

0 ALCHEMY BREW SCRIBE~
Syntax: brew <spell> container [spell-level]
Syntax: scribe <spell> parchment

In order to use these powerful skills, you must first have an empty
container or an unused parchment to brew and scribe, respectively.
Vials and parchments can be found at your local magic shop.  You may only
brew and scribe spells that you already know.  Keep in mind that attaching
spells to vials and parchments requires significantly more mana than
simply casting them.  There are other objects throughout Exodus that have
the same properties as vials and parchments that can be brewed into and
scribed upon.
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent. Only thieves
and bards may learn how to backstab. Those who have no skill in backstabbing
are intelligent enough to not even try.
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 BLINDFIGHTING~
The blindfighting skill, available to both warriors and paladins, when
carefully honed allows the adventurer to be more aware of what is happening
during a battle when blinded.  A player skilled in blindfighting is able
to compensate for the lack of sight by using his or her other senses.  This
compensation greatly increases the chances that the player will hit an
enemy while blinded and that if the hit does occur, it will cause more damage.
~

-1 BUTCHER~
A skill most easily honed by the nature-loving ranger, the act of butchering
allows the player to take the raw meat of dead corpses and extract
edible provisions.  This skill is also known to some adventurers of the
warrior and paladin classes.
~

-1 'CALL MOUNT'~
The call mount skill, known only to the paladin class, allows an adventurer
to call forth an animal that is ready and willing to act as a mount for
the player.  As an adventurer's level increases, so do the chances that
he or she will summon a more powerful mount.
~

0 CAMOUFLAGE~
Syntax: camouflage

If a ranger is completely familiar with his surroundings, he can completely
immerse himself into his environment, without any chance of anyone
detecting his presence should he remain absolutely still.
~

-1 CAMP CAMPING~
Syntax: camp
Those proficient in establishing camps will be able to delve into the
surrounding terrain to find loose logs, driftwood, weeds, and branches
in order to create small fires and places to rest in.  Once a camp
has been set up, nonintelligent creatures will avoid the site, and
all who rest near the campfire will regenerate at an accelerated rate.
~

-1 CHARGE~
A skill reserved for those with the bulk and brute strength of the warrior
class, charging allows an adventurer to storm quickly through a room in an
attempt to injure and knock down as many enemies as possible.  Due to the
mindless rage involved with charging, innocent bystanders are just as likely
to be hit as are enemies of the player.
~

-1 CIRCLE~
A particularly devious variation of backstab, the circle skill allows an
adventurer who is part of a larger group to orbit around the scene of the
battle and thrust their weapon into the back of an unsuspecting enemy.
No matter how stealthy the player, an attempt to circle around the
enemy currently being fought one-on-one will be subverted.  Only the
devious members of the thief class can master this skill.
~

0 COMPOSE REPERTOIRE COMPOSITION~
Syntax: compose <name>                  (To remove a composition)
Syntax: compose <name> <type> <title>   (To create a composition)
Syntax: repertoire                       (To view your repertoire)

The composition skill allows creative bards a means of writing their
own magical tunes.  By creating their own melodic variations of learned
music types, skilled bards can customize their repertoire of playable
songs.  Songs that are composed must be played on a suitable instrument,
not merely sung.

The compose command allows bards with the compose skill to write
songs of a certain style that can later be played on an instrument.
The number of songs you can have in your repertoire is determined by your
composition skill.  The name of the song is used to play the song ('play
<name>'), the song title will be shown to the players in the room when you
play it. The available musical styles are: aria, ballad, battlesong, dirge,
hymn, opera, symphony, melody, satire, sonnet, jig and warsong.  The
repertoire command may be used to view which custom songs you may play.

See the help file on `a[`lCUSTOM SONGS`a]`` for more information.
~

-1 CONCEAL~
A skill that comes easily to the devious thief, the nature-aware ranger
and the worldly bard, concealing allows the adventurer to mask their scent.
Those who cannot mask the scent of their presence will find themselves more
likely to be tracked down by other adventures and the wild creatures that
roam the realms of Exodus.
~

-1 CRITICAL 'CRITICAL STRIKE'~
Adventurers who are masters of combat know that attacking certain areas
of his or her opponent will do more damage than a normal hack and slash
would.  With that end in mind, some began studying the art of directing
strikes towards nerve centers and vulnerable spots on their opponent in
order to do increased damage with a normal attack.

Critical Strike is not an attack that is used manually.  Instead, it is
checked each round of combat.  Because of the difficulty in striking an
opponent's vital areas during the chaos of combat, there is only a very
small chance a critical strike can even be attempted.  If it is, though
and if the skill check is successful, the attacker can land a strike of
amplified intensity.  Assassins are the masters of the critical strike,
but warriors may learn it as well, although at greater cost and at much
higher level.
~

-1 HONE~
Intrepid warriors and rangers have learned to hone their weapons to maximum
sharpness.  This process can take a toll on the weapon and unskilled smiths
risk damaging their weapons horribly in the process.

Warriors may hone metallic weapons to a sharp edge by grinding them upon a
grinding stone.  Needless to say, this doesn't do much for blunt weapons.

Rangers, on the other hand, have harness their own nature skills to hone
wooden weapons over a fire until the points and edges are hard.  The foolish
ranger who tries this before mastering the skill might find himself wielding
a flaming weapon for a time, then nothing more than a pile of ashes.
~

0 'CUSTOM SONGS'~

Compositions have many different effects on the listener, depending on
what you choose to compose (name followed by minimum level to compose
in parentheses):

Composition types that have a non-hostile effect on listeners in the room:
Aria(1)        Sonnet(1)      Serenade(1)       Warsong(15)      Opera(15)
Jig(1)

Composition types that require a single audience, and do not incite anger:
Ballad(1)     Battlesong(10)     Hymn(10)          Melody(1)
Symphony(20)

Composition types that will have your audience chasing you down:
Dirge(10)       Satire(5)
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'DOOR BASH' 'DOORBASH' DB~
Warriors who are skilled in the ways of smashing down doors have the distinct
advantage of not having to acquire and carry around most keys to the doors of
Exodus.  Be forewarned, however, that a bashed door remains open and unlocked
to all of the inhabitants of Exodus, not simply the adventurer who performed
the bashing.
~

-1 'DUAL WIELD'~
The ability to wield two weapons, a skill which may be practiced by
warriors and rangers, vastly increases an adventurer's maneuverability
and flexibility in combat situations.  A major benefit of learning this skill
is that it increases the amount of hits the adventurer can perform and betters,
by diversifing the types of weapons used, the chances that the weapons on
hand will be effective against any enemy the adventurer may encounter.
~

-1 ELUSIVENESS~
Syntax: flee <direction(s)>

The elusiveness skill allows theives to slip out of combat in a specified
direction without an experience penalty when using flee with a directional
argument (which may consist of a single direction such as 'n', or a string of
two directions 'ns', or 'nd').  If the thief fails to elude his enemy in
a controlled manner, there is still a chance he or she may flee in a random
direction.
~

-1 ENDURANCE~
The endurance skill has been learned and perfected by those in the ranger
class over countless centuries in the realms of Exodus.  Long, hermetic
sabbaticals into the wild have taught these adventurers to conserve
their energy, using up their reserves at a much slower rate and surviving
for longer periods of time without the sustenance of food or water.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvenience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

0 EXORCISE EXORCISM~
The act of exorcism attempts to expel spirits of opposite alignment from
the very soul of the target, often sending that target into spasms of
intense pain.  The withdrawal of these spirits can often maim or kill
persons subjected to it, and the cleric performing the ritual must be
careful in doing this -- if wisdom and judgement are erroneous when
doing so, the cleric may find his own body being wrenched along in the
expelling.

Due to the massive spiritual power that exorcism requires, even the most
robust of clerics can only perform one once per day.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 FISHING~
The oceans and other bodies of water in the realms of Exodus are vast and
teeming with aquatic life.  Those skilled in the art of fishing are able to
use their wits to trap fish and other sea creatures to be eaten.  While all
classes are able to learn to fish, rangers are particularly well suited for
perfecting this art.
~

-1 FISTICUFFERY~
Adventurers highly skilled in the art of fisticuffery have learned where
and how to most effectively strike an enemy when fighting with their bare
hands.  As this fighting style often involves attacks thought to be without
honor, thieves are the most proficient with fisticuffery though it may also
be learned by warriors and bards.
~

-1 FORAGING FORAGE~
A skill reserved for the ranger in tune with nature, foraging allows
the player to sharpen his or her senses to the point where they can find
edible substances in the wild areas of Exodus.  Rangers who are highly skilled
may also find curative or healing herbs.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling,
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Exodus.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only bards and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 INFLUENCE~
Influence allows adventurers to beguile those around them and convince
them to part with money in one form or another.  Those skilled in the
art of influential mannerisms can convince merchants to give them better
prices for merchandise.  Bards, with their propensity for being highly
charismatic, are masters of the influence skill and may also use it to
receive donations from those they perform originally-composed songs to.
Paladins may also use this skill, though they may only use it to
lower the cost of goods.
~

-1 INSTRUMENTS~
The ability to coax an inanimate object into creating beautiful melodies
is the exclusive domain of the bard class.  Practiced bards who are skilled
in the art of playing instruments not only fill the realm of Exodus with
their elegant music, they are also able to harness the power of their songs
to perform amazing feats of magic.
~

-1 KAI~
The kai skill, available only to thieves, allows the practiced adventurer
to let out such a nerve-wracking scream that it can cause an immense,
immobilizing fear in the victim it is directed towards.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 KULDAR~
Dwarves who are enraged in battle and are wielding certain two-handed weapons
can inflict considerably more damage upon their enemies due to their
incredible mining skills and precision with two-handed mining instruments.
~

-1 LAYHANDS~
Lay hands is a unique skill that may only be mastered by the paladin class.
It is a special ability that paladin adventurers are granted that allows
them to lay their hands over the wounds of specified target, mend wounds
and recover a large amount of hit points.  Due to the enormous power required
for this healing to occur, the paladin may only attempt such a healing once
per day.
~

-1 LEADERSHIP~
An exclusive trait of the holy paladin, the leadership skill instills a sense
of pride and morale in all members of a group the adventurer is leading into
battle.  Because of their increased confidence in their ability to win the
fight, characters lead by those who have mastered this art are more likely to
hit, and will often cause an increased amount of damage, to their enemies.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  Most classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~

-1 MASK~

The supernatural ability of the Sidhe race with regard to altering
appearance is unparalleled by any other lifeform.  Utilizing their unique
commune with an ethereal phase of being, the Sidhe can 'mask' themselves,
changing their guise as to resemble another.  Because of the great
concentration and magical focus required to shift phase, masking oneself
draws a great deal of magical power from the Sidhe.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
~

-1 PALM~
An underhanded trick best learned by the dextrous thief, the palm skill
allows a player to take an object that is lying in the current room
with the possibility of the action not being see by others in the room.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting
attacks, and is successful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  Thieves are the main practitioners of this skill.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 REDIRECT~
The skill of redirection allows adventurers to reposition themselves in
battle so that their attacks are directed against a victim other than the
current one-on-one enemy without the need of fleeing or otherwise stopping
the battle.  Redirection can only be used on those enemies that the adventurer
is already fighting.  Because they may be physically out-of-reach during the
battle it cannot be used to start completely new attacks on another opponent.
Characters of the thief, warrior and ranger classes may learn the proper
methods of redirection.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 RETREAT~
Syntax: retreat <direction>

The retreat skill allows trained warriors to retreat from battle in a specific
direction without an experience penalty.  If the warrior fails to retreat
in a mannerly fashion, there is still a chance he or she may flee in a random
direction.
~

-1 RIDING~
The riding skill determines a character's proficiency in using animals as
a means of transportation.  Adventurers with a high degree of riding skill
will be much less likely to be thrown from mounted animals.  Those of any
class may learn to ride.  Rangers, with their vast knowledge of the wild,
are particularly adept at riding.
~

-1 SAP~
For ages, skilled assassins have had the ability to sneak up on someone and
strikeng them in the head to knock them unconscious.  When successful, this
skill proved invaluable for allowing the assassin an easy escape, but when
it failed, the enraged victim usually attacked the attacker.  Success at
sapping requires that the target be fully healed, and therefore complacent.
The sapper must also be wielding a sap, which is where the skill gets its
name from.  A sap can be found in seedier places if one goes looking.
Trying to sap someone of higher level becomes more difficult as the level
difference grows.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 STALK~
The stalk skill is the exclusive domain of the stealthy thief class.
An adventurer skilled in the art of stalking is able to automatically
follow another player through the realms of Exodus  without being seen or
otherwise detected.
~

-1 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers guard their merchandise
carefully.

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players. If you fail on
an attempt to steal in town, you may get a [WANTED] flag and will be
jailed if a guard sees you. Similarly, if you fail, you may gain a
loner flag if you are a noclan.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

-1 SWEEP~
The sweep skill is a highly evolved variation on kick.  An adventurer
skilled in this art can sweep their leg in a wide arc during combat,
adding an extra, powerful attack to their standard repertoire.  Though
masters in the art of sweeping can manage to avoid those known to be allies
with this attack, the wide angle of this strike may hit innocent bystanders in
addition to those the player is seeking to destroy.  Only warriors and
paladins can learn to master the sweep maneuver.
~

-1 ASSASSINATE~
The ancient art of assassination has been passed down by those in the thief 
class from generation to generation.  Those skilled in this dark and secretive
form of attack are able to use throwable weapons to injure, and often kill, 
their enemies from relatively long distances without being seen and without 
their victims knowing who it was that perpetrated the assault.

`oFor help on the assassins guild, type [`kHelp assassins`o]``
~

-1 SWIM SWIMMING DROWN DROWNING~
Much of the world of Exodus is covered by water.  Seas, oceans, streams, and
rivers divide the land masses making it difficult, if not impossible, for
adventurers to get from place to place.  The safest way to cross the largest
bodies of water is via a boat.  It is possible for adventurers to become
skilled in swimming, however, allowing them to cross medium distances of
water on their own.  There are also creatures that roam the waters of Exodus
that are capable of swimming for the adventurer, if he or she is smart or
lucky enough to catch one.  No matter how skilled an adventurer becomes at
swimming, though, there is a limited amount of time in which the swim skill
is effective.  As in real life, your character becomes tired of the movement
required to keep afloat and will begin to sink under and drown.  It is wise
for even the most excellent swimmers to avoid venturing out too far into
unknown waters.

See also [help underwater]
~

-1 TAME~
The majority of animals roaming the lands of Exodus are by no means domestic
and will prove to be too unwieldy should you try exploit them as means
of transportation.  The tame skill, which can only be truly mastered by
the ranger class, allows the adventurer to train the animal to be more
receptive to transporting characters.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 THROWING~
The ability to effectively throw suitable weapons at far-away enemies allows
adventurers to injure with less chance of a counter-attack from the victim
of the assault.  Thieves are particularly good at this skill though mages,
warriors and bards may also learn.  Whether or not you think throwing weapons
from afar is cowardly or genius depends greatly on whether you are the thrower
or throwee.
~

0 TRACK SCENT TRACKING~
Syntax: TRACK
Syntax: TRACK off
Syntax: TRACK <character or mobile>

TRACK attempts to track down the scent of a character.

Typing 'TRACK <character or mobile>' puts you into a heightened sense of
awareness whereby you may be able to pick up on the path left by
'character or mobile'.  All characters and mobiles leave scents in rooms,
except for immortals. For each movement you make, there is a chance
(determined by your track skill) that you will catch a scent of the
character (assuming there is one to be found within your surrounding area).
Scents fade after some time, and are lost when the target crosses water.
In some sectors such as hills, mountains, and swamps, it may be more
difficult to track things.

Typing 'TRACK off' lowers your awareness back to normal.

Typing 'TRACK' alone when you are tracking something tells you what
it is you are tracking.
~

-1 TRAMPLE~
The trample skill, which is available to rangers and paladins, allows an
adventurer that is mounted on a transportation animal to cause the animal
to stomp around madly in an attempt to hit an enemy.  If the specified
enemy is unfortunate enough to be hit by the adventurer's mount, he
or she will be wounded.   The larger the enemy is, the easier it is to
guide the animal into trampling them.
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.
~

-1 UNDERWATER~
There are areas in the world of Exodus that are entirely submerged in water.
Travelling to these areas can prove difficult, if not suicidal, for most
adventurers.  Like you, your character can only live without oxygen for a
short period of time without beginning to drown.  As no oxygen is directly
available to air-breathing races under water, your adventurer will need
some sort of aid to remain underwater for long periods of time.  There
are magical spells and items strewn about the world of Exodus that make it
possible to breathe  underwater for a longer period of time.

See also [help drowning]
~

-1 UPPERCUT~
The uppercut skill allows you to deliver a powerful uppercut assault on your
opponent as an extra attack during combat.  Those who are proficient in
the art of hand-to-hand combat and are also well practiced with uppercut
will deliver particularly damaging blows to their enemies.  Those who overuse
uppercut without the proper training, however, are apt to over-stretch the
muscles in their arms, causing temporary loss of strength.
~

-1 'WALL OF THORNS'~
Syntax: create 'wall of thorns' (direction)

A skill reserved for the ranger class, wall of thorns allows an adventurer
to construct a dangerous structure at the entrance/exit of a room.  Once
such a wall has been created, players who attempt to enter or exit the room
in the direction in which the wall has been constructed will be harmed
by the sharp thorns.
~

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap')
~

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE STAFF DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SWORD STAFF~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
staff           skill in long stick-like weapons
~

0 ! HISTORY~

   Exodus supports a 20-slot command history buffer.  If you wish to repeat
the last command you entered, type '!' on a blank line and hit return.
If you wish to repeat any command of your last twenty, type '!' on a blank
line, followed by how many commands back it is, followed by return.  For
example, if you wish to repeat your second to last command, type '!2'.
'!1' repeats your last command and functions exactly like '!'.  For a list of
commands you have entered and the number to use to repeat them, type '!?'.

If you were hoping to read the history of the mud, type story at the prompt,
or look at the area list and type help <any help file listed> for individual
area helps.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be substituted at this time.
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~

Exodus uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:


autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist : makes you help group members in combat


Typing a command sets the action, typing it again removes it.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

-1 CLS CLEAR~

If your terminal supports ansi codes, you can type CLS to clear your
screen.
~

0 COLOR~
Syntax: color on|off [to turn color on and off]
Syntax: color [to see all the settable options in the game]

Exodus supports fully customizable ANSI colors, not only
in specified options, but in *anything*, including titles,
says, emotes, et cetera.

The following shows you ways to construct these colors:

Example: >say `Zj`Z7Hi!  produces the word '`j`7Hi!``'
`Z7White BG        `Z9Blue BG         `Z0Red BG

To exit your current color at any time:
`Z`Z Back to Normal
To display the grave character to other players, type `ZZ.
~

0 COMBINE~
Syntax: combine

COMBINE toggles whether items sharing the same short description are displayed
seprately or lumped together as one entry with the number in parenthesis when
shown on the ground or in an inventory.
~

0 EMAIL~

Syntax: email <address>

Allows you to change the e-mail address you have logged with the MUD. Please keep
your e-mail address current.
~

-1 GAIN~

Syntax: gain level

The gain command is used to advance your level.  If you have enough experience
points to advance, the cost will be deducted from your experience points and
your level will increase by 1.  You will go to your guildmaster to gain levels.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell|prayer|song|chant>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  If you have the exp
required to improve the skill or spell, it will be deducted from you and your
proficciency with that skill or spell will increase by 5%.  Having a higher
Intelligence can make the cost of practicing slightly less.  You must be at a
guild master to practice.

Practice points, which were used under the old system, no longer exist under
the new system because all practicing is done by spending exp.
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>

PROMPT without an argument will turn your prompt on or off.

PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.

PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level

	%s :  Display silver carried
	%S :  Display sneak/hide/invis condition.
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds generates excessive lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

Also, if you get a strange message when you try to quit, don't worry.
Be sure to read `bhelp FIGHT LAG``.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created You can use TITLE
to set your title to something else.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con cha hp mana move>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute.  You start with
two sessions when your character is created and you receive one session
per level, until level 10.

Training STR will affect the chance of hitting a target and your damage.
Training INT will affect the mana you get each level and the cost of
	practicing.
Training WIS will affect the mana you get each level.
Training DEX will lower your armor class and affect the moves you get
	each level.
Training CON will affect the hitpoints you get each level.
Training CHA can sometimes affect the way aggressive monsters react to you.

Also, certain skills/spells/prayers/songs/chants use your stats as a
basis for success or failure.

See also [help level] and [help gain].
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 ATTRIBUTES STRENGTH INTELLIGENCE WISDOM DEXTERITY CONSTITUTION CHARISMA HAND HANDEDNESS~

`oStrength: Not only does this reflect raw muscular strength, but the ability
to use it. `kStrength affects how many hit points you get each level, what
weapons you may wield, how much you can carry, and how much damage you
do. `oWarriors rely on their strength the most, and Vro'ath and Dwarves tend
tend to be the strongest races.

Intelligence: Intelligence reflects pure brain-power. `kIt affects how much
you learn when you practice skills and spells, how much mana you get each
level, and several other minor things.`o Mages tend to rely on intelligence.
Elves, sidhe, and humans are the most intelligent of races.

Wisdom: `kWisdom helps define how much mana you have to call upon, how much
experience you get from kills (higher wisdom gets your more exp while lower
wisdom gets you less), and how you react to spells.`o Where intelligence 
is raw learning and brainpower, wisdom is more along the lines of critical
thinking and common sense. Clerics rely on wisdom more than anything else, as
do Canthi and Syvin.

Dexterity: Nimbleness and flexibility, a dexterous individual can step aside
before being cut in half. `kDexterity affects dodging and parrying, armor class,
how long you can travel before resting, and how many items you can keep upon
your person.`o Thieves live and die by their dexterity. Elves, Syvin, and Sidhe
tend to be the most lithe of races.

Constitution: Hardiness and resilience, rangers are the prime example of
constitution in action. `kConstitution defines how many hit points you will
have, how long you can travel before resting, and how well you resist poison
and disease. `oDwarves, Vro'ath, and Syvin are the hardiest of races.

Charisma: Possibly one of the most mind-bogglingly confusing statistics
on Exodus (maybe even the entire universe!), is the trait of being able
to fervently lead or influence people -- a personal magnetism that affects
how well you communicate with other beings on the MUD.  Bards and Paladins,
are probably the most charismatic classes of players you will ever meet.
`kCharisma affects your ability to charm others if you have that ability,
whether aggressive monsters attack you or leave you alone, and whether
others react badly to you trying to push or drag them.`o  Racially speaking,
the graceful and aesthetically pleasing nature of elves practically
guarantees adoration.  Humans and Canthi aren't far behind, using their
wiles to seduce even the most astute adventurer into doing their bidding.

Handedness: Your handedness (which is selected during character generation
and may be one of left, right or ambidextrous) determines something about
how much damage wielded weapons are capable of.
~

-1 BARRISTER~

Any player over level 25 may apply to the Exodus School of Law, pass the
Bar Exam and become registered to practice in the Courts of Exodus. This
will also entitle the player to build a law office in the courts building.


Players accused of major crimes and set for trial in court may hire, or
have appointed, any registered barrister. Fees for representation are set
by individual barristers, but a fee set by the court will be paid for any
appointed cases.

Client confidentiality is of major importance. Once hired, no barrister may
divulge any material of a case to any outside source. This includes players
and immortals of any standing. Failure of confidentiality is reason for
disbarment.

Barristers may be selected by the general population to serve as prosecutors
for the court if they so desire. Affirmation by the immortal staff will be
required.

0 BUILD BUILDING HOMES HOUSES CLANHALLS 'PLAYER BUILDING'~
Syntax: build <direction>
Syntax: build


   The build command allows you to build your own room within the realms of
Exodus.  Rooms do not come cheap and they cannot be built everywhere.
If you wish to build your own room, you must acquire enough money to buy
the room, and must find a suitable development area in which to stake
your claim.  Once you find this area, you can use the build command with
a directional argument to build your room in that direction from the
current room.  Once you have built your first room, you can expand at will,
creating constructs to the limits of your imagination.

   Your room starts out in a very minimal, bare state.  In order to customize
the room to your tastes, you should enter the room and type the build command
again, without any arguments.  This will put you into a build menu that
allows you to easily and quickly change your room to match your tastes,
assuming you can afford the changes.  The prices for each change will be
listed on the build menu.

   The main building menu presents you with six choices:

     (1) Remodel your room    : Allows you to change the description of you
                                room, so that players see a different message
                                when they 'look' in your room.

     (2) Rename your room     : Allows you to change the name of your room
                                that appears above your room description when
                                players type 'look' in your room.

     (3) Edit room flags      : Allows you to add or remove special flags
                                in your room.

     (4) Edit room keywords   : Allows you to create and remove special room
                                keywords, so that when players type
                                'look <keyword>' in your room, they see the
                                description you supplied.

     (5) Edit room doors/keys : Allows you to create or remove doors and keys
                                from your room, to limit access.

     (6) Exit building menu   : Exits the building menu and brings you back
                                to the main exodus prompt.


   If you choose the remodeling room option, you will be placed into a
small text editor that you can use to enter the new description of your room.
When you are finished, you should type the '@' key and hit return on an
otherwise blank line.

   If you choose the rename room option, you will be prompted for the new
room name.  Enter it carefully, as the line you enter will become your new
room name unless you choose to buy a new one.

   If you choose the edit room flags option, you will be placed in a submenu
that allows you to easily add and remove flags.  To add a flag, simply
type 'A' followed by the number of the room flag to add (shown on the menu)
and return.  If you have enough money to buy the room flag, it will be
added to your room.  If you change your mind, you can delete flags you have
added by selecting '2' followed by the number of the room flag to remove
(also shown on the menu) and return.  You may leave this submenu and go back
to the main menu by typing '3' followed by return.  The flags available
for adding to your room include: Room is dark (the room is always dark,
those without light sources cannot see inside it), No Mobs Allowed (mobs
cannot enter your room), Room is Private (only two people may be in your
room at one time), No Mounts Allowed (no mounted mobiles will be allowed
in your room), Room is Indoors (the room is indoors and its inside will
not be affected by the weather or time of day).

   If you choose the edit keyword option, you will be placed in a submenu
that allows you to add and remove keywords.  To add a keyword, select
'1' at this menu.  You will be prompted for the keyword name and for
the description that should be shown when this keyword is looked at.
If you later change your mind, you can use the '2' option at this menu
to delete the keyword.  You may leave this submenu and go back to the main
menu by typing '3' followed by return.


  If you choose the doors/key edit option, you will be placed in a submenu
that allows you to add and remove doors and keys.  To add a lockable door
to your room, select '1' followed the the letter for the room direction
(supplied on the menu) and return.  The door will be created for you.
If you change your mind and wish to delete a door, select '2' at this menu
followed by the letter for the room direction and return.  If you want to
make a single key for a door you have created, to limit access to your
room, select '3' at this menu.  You may leave this submenu and go back to
the manu menu by typing '4' followed by return.

  You may leave the build menu and return to the normal exodus prompt by
typing '6' at the main menu.


 `oCLAN HALLS``: Clan leaders can also build clan halls specifically for
their clan's use.  The procedure is the same as above, except for an added
charge, the clan leader can specify a CLAN_ONLY flag.

 `oSHOPS``:  Players can also build shops using the build system.  The
process exactly mirrors that of building personal rooms and homes -
player run shops must be staffed by a player in order for the shop to be
open.  Eventually, there will be such things as shopkeeper mobs for hire.
~

-1 COURT COURTS~

The Courts of Exodus are designed to give players who are accused of a
major infraction a chance defend themselves before a jury of players.
Court proceedings are, in all but unusual circumstances, open to the
public.

An immortal will preside as Judge in court cases, but all other trial
participants will be mortals. High level players will be chosen to be
prosecutors, and players over the level of 25 may choose to take the
steps needed to become barristers in the realm. Players who are charged
with offenses may defend themselves, or hire a barrister. The accused
has a right to council, and if a player cannot afford a barrister, one
may be appointed by the court upon request.

Jury verdicts must be unanimous in the finding of guilt or innocence of
the player on trial. If a player is found to be guilty, the immortal
judging the case will pass sentence based on the penal code of Exodus.

There is no appeal process, therefore the finding of the jury is final.
In a case where the jury deadlocks, the prosecutor may seat a second jury,
with two deadlocked juries being the limit on any one case. A player may
not be tried twice for any offense.

Trial records, penal codes, and related materials are accessible to any
barrister register with the Court of Exodus. The required material will
also be made available to any player who wishes to self-defend in court.

Players may be subpoenaed by the court to testify in any case.

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

Exodus is the result of many strains of derivative code and
thousands of hours of dedication from its implementors and world
forgers. <wizlist>
To see the credits for its ancestors,
type <help diku>, <help merc>, and <help rom>.

We like to think of Exodus not just as a mud, but as a Post Linear
Reality.  The word mud is too connotative of a game, and while this
is indeed a place we anticipate you will enjoy countless hours of fun,
the virtual experience that comes from living on a mud, is a strain
of reality too often overlooked by those creating net environments.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you will be reincarnated at the Altar in the
Cathedral of Thesden.  The exception to this rule is when you belong to
a clan and your clan has flagged one of their clan hall rooms as a
clan_altar.  In this case, you would be reincarnated at that particular
room.  In either event, your corpse is left behind in the room where you
were killed, together with all of your belongings.

When killed, your character's permanent traits remain pretty much intact though
any spells which were affecting you are cancelled.  Following and groups are
not affected by death.   When you awake from your rebirth, your character will
be in a shocked state and will require time to rebuild his or her strength and
power to walk around.  You do lose experience points for dying.  The amount
you lose is two-thirds of the way back to the beginning of your current level.

The most common way to die in the world of Exodus is by being fatally wounded
in combat.  There are, however, other ways in which an adventurer may die.
Your character, like you, can not live forever without food and water.  If you
do not take in sufficient amounts of both you will find yourself beginning
to starve or become thirsty.  The best strategy is to keep your character
stocked with ample food and drink at all times.  If you find yourself starving
or dying of thirst and have no supplies, your first priority should be to
buy, find, beg for or steal provisions.  Your character also needs oxygen
in order to breathe and function correctly, so going under water for long
periods of time without some type of breathing aid can cause you damage and,
after prolonged periods of time, death.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  After you reach a
predetermined number of experience points, you can increase your level by
going to your guildmaster and typing 'gain level.'  Unlike in the past, exp
for a certain mob is the same whether you are level 1 or level 90.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills a monster or by
killing a monster on your own.  You can also receive experience by
participating in quests, either built in area ones or immortal run ones.
You lose experience by fleeing from combat, recalling out of combat,
being the target of certain spells and dying.

If you are in a group, the experience points you gain together is divided
among the group members using the shares system.  [help group] will give
you more details on how the shares system works.

Your character gains in power as it levels, increasing in statistics
and skills alike.  Your hitpoint gains depend on your strength and
constitution; your mana on intelligence and wisdom.

Note that level gains are based on your natural stats, not on equipment
enhanced stats.

0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~

-1 JURY~

The Courts of Exodus will require the general population to act as jurors
for major criminal cases. Players will be asked to register for jury duty
before a trial, and will be expected to remain for the duration.

A jury will be comprised of five (5) players with two (2) alternates. No
clan members of the accused will be allowed to serve on a jury. Jurors
will be compensated by the court for the time taken by the trial.

Jurors will be expected to work toward a verdict. Deadlocked juries will
happen occasionally, but should not happen often. The prosecution MUST
prove to the jury, beyond a REASONABLE DOUBT, that the crime was committed
by the accused. Immortals have certain methods of observation that are
not available to mortals, and while this must be understood, it does not
add addition and conclusive weight to any testimony.

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Exodus' economy is based on gold and silver coinage.  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Most prices in the realm are in
silver denomination, unless otherwise specified.
~

0 NOLOOT NOSUMMON~
Syntax: noloot
Syntax: nosummon

Toggles whether people may loot your corpse or summon you via the summon spell.
Loners and Clanned people may always be looted or summoned.
~

-1 'IMM ENCHANT'~
Immortals will enchant your weapon or armor up to a maximum of +10.
This means +10 total, not 10 enchants on top of its current bonus.
The costs are as follows:

+1  = 1 quest token
+2  = 2 quest tokens
+3  = 3 quest tokens
+4  = 4 quest tokens
+5  = 5 quest tokens
+6  = 6 quest tokens
+7  = 7 quest tokens
+8  = 8 quest tokens
+9  = 9 quest tokens
+10 = 10 quest tokens

This means if you have an unenchanted sword and want it enchanted to +3,
it will cost you 1 token to get to +1, 2 tokens to get you to +2, and then
3 tokens to get to +3 for a total of 6 tokens.  If you have a sword which
is already +7 and you want it to get to +10, then it will cost 8+9+10= 27
quest tokens.

If the enchant increases the item by +2 instead of +1 you do not have to
pay extra--it's just your own good luck.
~

-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 'PLAYER STORE' STORE STORES STOCK UNSTOCK~

`iCreating a store:``
`f-----------------``

	In order to create a player-run store, you must have built a room
for yourself.  When in your built room, use the 'build' command in order
to get a building menu.  From this menu, select option "3", to edit your
rooms flags.  From the room flag editing menu, select "1 H" in order to
add a store flag -- you will need sufficient money to pay for the flag.
Once the store flag is added, you can begin stocking inventory.

`iNOTE!!!  Closing the store is the ONLY way to ensure that your eq is
safe from thieves!``


`iOpening and Closing the store:``
`f------------------------------``

In order to begin selling to the public, the store must be opened.
To open the store, the owner must go to the build menu using the
'build' command, go to the flag edit menu by selecting '3' and then selecting
the  "Store is open" flag by selecting "1 I".  The store may be closed by
removing the "Store is open" flag ("2 I").  When the store is open, players
may list store inventory, buy objects for sale, and even attempt to steal
these objects.   Please note: a closed store only means the inventory
for-sale is locked away.  Players may still enter the store's room unless
it is locked up.

`iAdding inventory:``
`f-----------------``

To take an object you have in your personal inventory and add it to the
store's inventory, use the 'stock' command (eg. "stock sword").  If you wish
to change the price of the object, you can add a price value to the stock
command (eg. "stock sword 100").  All price values are in silver.

`iSelling items:``
`f--------------``

In order to sell items, a shop keeper must be present.  The shopkeeper may be
either the store owner, or a employee mob that can be hired using the 'hire'
command. (Please talk to an immortal in order to gain employee mobs).  An
employee may be hired by typing 'hire (hours)' where hours are the number of
hours to hire the mob to act as shopkeeper.  The hours a mob shopkeeper
may be hired for range from 1 to 10 (game hours).  When a mob shopkeeper
is on duty, all money made from sales will be deposited into the store
owner's bank account.
~

0 WANTED JUSTICE~
Realizing that a perception of thievery and rampant murder would be harmful to
their businesses, a coalition of merchants have pressured the local governments
into enacting and enforcing a code of law within the cities of Exodus.  In
particular, stealing from or killing another adventurer has been outlawed.
If any players you are trying to steal from catch you in the act, they
will let out a scream that the city guards will hear and you will become
wanted.  Similarly, if you kill any other players while within the city walls,
it is certain that some townspeople will see what you have done and report
you to the guards.  A wanted player loses all refuge and will be pulled into
jail, or attacked, upon being see by the guardsmen of the city.  Crimes do have
a statute of limitations whose time period is increased the more you become
wanted.  When arrested, your time in jail will also grow the more you are
caught committing crimes.

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.

~

-1 SIDHE~
Though recognized as the common ancestor of drow and elves, the sidhe are
also direct predecessors of pixies, sylphs, and sprites.  The sidhe have 
existed longer than any of the former, but are rarely seen due to a
completely aversive nature and genetic makeup.

Sidhe are relatively tall and generally lithe, though nowhere near as
graceful as their elven descendants.  Most Sidhe exhibit skin complexions
ranging from moderate gray to pale blue, and can fly utilizing the double
set of fragile webbed wings extending from just above their shoulders.
Being slightly out of phase with the world, the Sidhe are somewhat
ectoplasmic, having the ability to pass through barriers that would pose
problems to members of any  other race.

Having spent centuries away from any form of life, the Sidhe have evolved
from a purely mischievious and cunning race into vile creatures that hold
all other races in contempt and hatred.  This ingrained hatred is so strong
that any Sidhe attempting to change their alignment will find themselves
biologically compelled to remain the same.

The Sidhe form of linguistics is so completely removed from any common
language spoken that most will find it impossible to communicate with any
other than Sidhe.  It is rumored that very advanced members of the race can
manage    some semblance of communication with other races, at great physical
cost.

It is highly recommended that this race be chosen by only advanced players,
for the Sidhe restrictions in socialization and communication will prove   
exceedingly difficult to those unfamiliar with the realms.

-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at  
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of  
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,   
they are more versitile, being skilled in all the classes. Humans may   
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.  Historically, all great paladins
to have wandered the realms of Exodus have been humans.

-1 VROATH VROATHS~
The Vro'ath are large bipedal creatures whose appearance is considered
repulsive by humans.  Trolls and ogres are often used as comparisons in 
the descriptions of how the Vro'ath look. The average intelligence of the
Vro'ath can be considered ponderous, at best.  However, they have been blessed
with some brilliant and able leaders in the past, and still have some
competent ones now. The Vro'ath are primarily a militaristic race and are
ruled by the iron fist of army and church leaders.  They worship one god,
whom they call Ne'shajh and believe to be the physical manifestation of all
the abstract forces that drive the universe.  The Vro'ath economy is mainly
sustained by slave trade.  These slaves are often prisoners of war taken in
the numerous military victories of the Vro'ath.

-1 CANTHI~
The Canthi are a mysterious race of seafarers many centuries removed from  
their genetic ancestors, who some claim were originally humans, and others,
elves.  Only coming ashore infrequently to restock supplies not provided 
by the ocean and to trade their goods with land-dwellers, the Canthi have
transmuted from simple sailors to a people perfectly adapted to the harsh
conditions of sea travel - their thick brown and green skin along with 
the thin strands of hair that grow close together in dense mops of hair
provide protection from the torturous near-12 hour exposure to the sun
that they face daily and also give them a natural resistance to fire
attacks, but are vulnerable to cold attacks.

Canthi are of similar stature to humans, although for the most part more
lean and gaunt-looking.  Their vast knowledge of ocean environments aids
them as rangers, and their mysterious vocal harmony (helped in part by
the rows of gill slits on their neck) makes them good bards.

The projected, hollow wails of the Canthi are well-known at ports  
throughout every continent as signals of their arrival.  Their odd,
echoing voice is both haunting and disturbing, enhanced by the two rows of
gill flaps that rest directly under their chins.  Those Canthi that have
chosen a life of living on land (which is very rare) can often make
excellent earnings as bards in small port towns, combining their unique
vocal rhythms with tales from the sea.

~

-1 SYVIN~
The Syvin race is very similar to elves, in fact they are distant cousins.
As lovers of nature, they respect all animals, and only hunt for survival
purposes.  Detesters of large civilizations, they prefer to live in small 
villages buried deep in the forests.  From their simplistic nature, they  
have learned to be self-sufficient and detest the use of metal in anything,
preferring instead to use a variety of other materials for weapons and
building.

-1 AVATAR AVATARS~
Avatars are people who have reached the peak of their mortal ability and
have become semi-divine spirits in an attempt to go even further.  One is
not born an avatar, but rather, one becomes an avatar.  As such, Avatars
possess special abilities.  As demigods, they are able to raise their
physical and mental statistics beyond the limits imposed on other mortal
races. Additionally, their hitpoint, mana, and movement gains can go higher
than is possible for other races as well.  Due to their divine nature, they
have a natural resistance to holy attacks.  Avatars are also unaffected by
restrictions that prevent others from using equipment and items based on
alignment, race, or guild.  Avatars are truly an order above all others.

But with great power comes great responsibility.  As heavenly creatures,
they have been given only one shot at mortal life.  If an Avatar should
fall for ANY reason, be it in battle, from poison, from drowning, or even
from hunger or thirst, his time on Exodus would be at an end and he would
re-enter the mortal world through the process of reincarnation as his
former race.

-1 KALIAN~
Similar to vampires, Kalians are a race that feeds off of the blood of their
victims.  No one knows exactly how long they've been around, for only
recently has the island that they inhabit been discovered.  Unlike vampires,
though, Kalians don't have to hide during they day.  They do get weaker, and
the sunlight hurts their eyes to the point that they may go blind for a short
period of time. But during the night, they get stronger and can attack more
during battle.  They are also adept at sneaking through the shadows at night,
and they don't even have to worry about trying to do it, it just happens
naturally.  They can see in the dark, and will never need a light to guide
their way.  They have resistances to almost all weapon damage, and cold and
lightning as well. Poison does absolutely nothing to them, although holy and
fire cause a great deal of damage.  They are extremely strong and intelligent
and dexterous, but not very charismatic or wise.  They're constitution is
pretty much non-existent as well.

Kalians have new skills that have never been seen before.  They are able to
make a complete copy of themselves and leave it in a room, while they just
walk away.  They also have a biting type skill that gives them health from
their victim.  Because of their ghost-like look, they are easily able to
instill fear into their opponent, forcing them to flee from battle and
causing them to have nightmares. 

NOTE: Kalians see only in red, grey and white.  They start out with 0 xp  
right after remort.  Anything that you gain while Kalian is NOT added 
to your total xp.  If you decide that you do not like the race, then you  
can reincarnate.  You go back to the race that you were before with no
loss of xp.  You do not change classes while Kalian, either.  When you
remort, then you must stay the same classes you were before the remort.

-1 LICH LICHES~
A lich is the undead embodiment of a powerful mortal who has undergone a
bizarre and unholy ritual at the hands of a necromancer.  In the quest for
immortality, the lich has traded its eternal soul for power in this realm.

A lich's visage is ghastly and terrifying.  Decaying flesh is stretched
tightly over a withered skeletal figure.  The shape of bones can be seen
beneath the leathery mummified skin.  Little trace of the original race
remains after the transformation ceremony imolates the body and damns the
soul to remain in the mortal world.  Due to the unclean nature of the soul
of the lich, healing and blessing prayers no longer lend any relief to the
creature.  As with all undead creatures, healing spells actually harm the
Lich.

Liches have several unholy powers which they alone possess and which can
cause great pain and suffering to those around them.  The lich is the most
feared and powerful of all the undead beings.  It has not only great strength
and stamina, but superhuman intelligence as well.  Liches are resistant to
many things which would damage mortls or kill them outright.  because of the
purely evil nature of the Lich, it is feared and hated and attacked on sight
if it ever dares to enter any civilized population.

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE STAFF DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SWORD STAFF~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.

-1 'DANCE OF WILD' 'DANCE WILD' 'DANCE OF THE WILD'~

        cast 'cancellation' <character>

Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considered an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.

The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

0 'ELECTRICAL CHARGE'~

penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.

the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment

This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.

-1 MIRROR~
A deceptive spell known only to the craftiest of mages, the mirror spell's
reputation alone can evoke feelings of consternation and distrust from even
those closest to the magic-wielder.

The spell, when cast, calls forth a liquid wall of reflective energy around
the caster, only visible by magical means.  Any who attempt to strike the
caster via mundane means will find themselves striking at air, and then
themselves, often resulting in confusion, hysteria, or suicide.

Although this powerful field cannot be penetrated by physical means,
the powers of the supernatural can easily pass through to cause harm to
the mage.  High-pitched noises can shatter the field, and any magical
energy released from within the field will instantly destroy it as well.

Syntax: cast 'pass door'

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
Some doors have been magically warded against the 'pass door' spell.

victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with
drastically reduced effectiveness.
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.

This spell summons a character from anywhere else in the world into your room.

This spell allows the caster to call forth a bee which will perform a harmful
sting upon the character.
~

0 'BEE SWARM'~
Syntax: cast 'bee swarm' <character>

A much more powerful form of the bee sting spell, this spell calls forth

are more effective against demonic beings).
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: pray 'calm'

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm prayer, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.

0 'DISPEL EVIL' 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Dispel evil invokes the wrath of the immortals on an evil victim. It can
be very dangerous for casters who are not pure of heart.

~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: pray 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy prayer fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety,
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
prayer (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the cleric's
alignment.
~

~

0 'HOLY WATER'~
Syntax: pray 'holy water'

The prayer of holy water allows the cleric to call forth a divine spring
of water that all passers-by may use to quench their thirst.  As many water
sources of Exodus are not fit for consumption, praying for holy water while
underwater will not result in any drinkable water.
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: pray 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disastrous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this prayer, being left unable to move and

portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: pray 'plague' <target>

The plague prayer infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,

magically shrouded with invisibility.

This haunting tune causes such a great amount of despair and anguish in the
person it is sung to that it causes them to slip into a depression that

chances that they will hit their enemies in combat are reduced. Worse,
sometimes the poor victim will be so depressed as to drop pertinent items.
~

0 'FALKENTYNES FURY'~
Syntax: sing 'falkentynes fury' <character>

The song of Falkentynes Fury allows charismatic bards to inspire the
character to greater feats of strength in combat.  Though this inspired rage
makes the character a much more deadly enemy, it also opens the character
up for more damage as he or she is blinded by the rage and less able to
worry about his or her own survival.
~

0 'GOOD VIBRATIONS'~
Syntax: sing 'good vibrations'

The tune of Good Vibrations is so loud and harsh that it causes the earth
to shake, injuring other characters that are in the vicinity of the
bard who is singing it.

character's first kiss of love, rejuvenating the character causing him or
her to be less tired and feel less pain of wounds.

The din that acts as the underscore for this loud and disagreeable

what situation they happen to be in.

Syntax: sing 'the pipers melody'

A song for the skilled bard, Piper's Melody compels those who hear it

him or her anywhere, and do anything for them. The number of followers is
related to the charisma of the bard.
~

0 'TO THE FOUR CORNERS'~

stored in his blade.  Once invoked, the magic is lost until the sword is
"recharged" at the unholy altar.

Syntax: invoke 'hellscape' (This would invoke the Hellscape burst for example)
~

-1 'CALL FOR SWORD`~

-1 CHARMIES 'CHARMIES AND PETS'~

CHARMIES, PETS AND MOUNTS

Through the use of magic spells, songs and other paraphernalia, it is
possible to use charmed mobs and player characters that are under your
control (commonly referred to as 'charmies'), to kill player characters.
Please keep in mind that when doing this, you are at all times responsible
for the actions of your charmies as if they were your own actions, whether
you ordered them to act or not.  This means that if you avoid some kind of
punishment by using a charmie to kill for you, you will be given the
appropriate punishment by an Immortal and/or the Exodus code-base just as
if you made the kill yourself.  Much in the same way, you are responsible for
any pets or mounts that you are an owner of.

Your charmies, pets and mounts are subject to the same rules and local laws
(see 'help laws') that you are subject to.

Do not leave aggressive mobs outside of areas from which they originated.  If
you have taken a mob outside of its area of origination and they later
initiate an attack upon a player character and kill the player character, you
will be held indirectly responsible for the player character's death and
subject to penalties regarding indirect PK (see 'help Indirect PK').
~

-1 'ILLEGAL PK'~

ILLEGAL PK

Only player characters that are in a clan or are a loner may attack and/or
kill player characters outside of the arena.  A loner is marked with a [*]
flag beside their name.  To see a list of clan symbols, type 'clan list'.
It is illegal to attack and/or kill a non-clanned player character.  Clans
that are an exception to this rule, that are to be treated like non-clanned
player characters and must act as such, can be viewed by typing
'help clan exceptions'.

You may not kill linkdead players by direct or indirect means.

For more information on Illegal PK and the roles that Non-PK characters and
PK characters have in this, see 'help Indirect PK', 'help Non PK/PK Roles',
'help PK Levels' and 'help Multikilling'.
~

-1 IMMORTAL 'IMMORTAL ROLES'~

IMMORTAL ROLES

The Exodus Immortals have a multitude of jobs to do including helping new
players get acquainted with the game, coding, building areas, running
quests and making sure that Exodus' rule set is followed.  Because we do
not wish to promote the use of bugs that are not widely known (see
'help cheating'), from time to time an Immortal may be enforcing a rule
that is not posted in the rule help files.  It is wiser to question an
Immortal ahead of time regarding a course of action rather than doing
something you are unsure of, only to find that you have broken a rule.

Some rule infractions are treated more severely than others.  The role of
Exodus Immortals also extends to judging how harshly a player is punished
or penalized for a rule infraction.  Because the decision regarding
penalties depends on a variety of variables such as what rule was broken,
was it purposely done, has it been done before by this character or
another character this player owns, ... etc., there can be no set
penalties for infractions.  Immortals are free to judge each infraction on
a case by case basis, taking the situation's circumstances into account.

If an Immortal asks you to do something, please do it as long as it does
not conflict with any other posted rules.  If you feel an Immortal's
penalty for a rule infraction that *YOU* commited is unjust, you may
privately appeal the Immortal's decision to Admin via real-time chat,
use of the note board or through e-mail.  Additionally, privately contact
an Admin if you suspect an Immortal of wrong-doing (and have some sort of
proof available).

Please do not
... ask for or accept favors from an Immortal.  The Immortal Staff will
assist you in many ways, but they may not help you in a manner that would
not be normally available to other players.
... continue to argue with an Immortal after they have ruled on a situation.
You may appeal their decision if you wish, but if you are turned down, you
may not continue to harass the staff with the issue.
... social the Immortal Staff without clear permission, especially not with
insulting or sexually oriented socials.
... attempt to kill an Immortal, steal from them, charm them, pray, sing or
cast spells on them without that Immortal's specific permission to do so.
~

-1 INDIRECT 'INDIRECT PK'~

INDIRECT PLAYER-KILLING

The killing of player characters by indirect means takes place when you or a
mob, pet or charmie that you control causes a player character to die without
making a killing blow during a combat round.  For the purposes of determining
culpability in player-killing cases, lethal actions have been divided into
combat round actions and non-comat round actions.

Combat round actions are actions which occur during a face-to-face battle,
in which blows can be exchanged, or in the case of throwing from another
room, involve a weapon striking a victim.

Non-combat round actions are actions which do not involve battle, where no
blows can be exchanged.  Most of these actions do not initiate combat.

In all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player character by means
of any non-combat round action.  Some examples of this are forcing a player
character to sleep against their will through the use of a spell or song and
then allowing them to starve or dehydrate, summoning a player character to
an ambush and not attacking them yourself, teleporting a player character
to an aggressive area, or intentionally pushing aggressive monsters into a
room with a player.

Indirect player-killing IS permitted, however, if it is done by means of a
combat round action AND the victim is within your level range (8 levels above
or below your own level).  An example of this would be where you poisoned a
character by means of a poisoned weapon or through the use of a spell and
you then died in combat.  If they later die due to the poison, you are
innocent of indirect player-killing.  This facet of Indirect Player-Killing
is open to interpretation by the Immortal Staff as to the circumstances
regarding how a character died by indirect means and as such should not be
abused by mortals.  In other examples, the motives of the character who is
considered responsible for the indirect PK, in addition to questions about
why combat terminated will be considered when rendering judgement.

Do not leave aggressive mobs outside of the areas from which they originated.
If you have taken a mob outside of its area of origination and they later
initiate an attack upon a player character and kill the player character, you
will be held indirectly responsible for the player character's death and
subject to penalties regarding indirect PK.

You cannot engineer your own Indirect PK.  If you try to do so and the imms
catch you, the imms laugh at you and then punish you.  This rule is designed
as a shield and not as a weapon for players to use against each other.  This
means that if the imms catch someone going into a situation with the
intention of being a "victim" of indirect PK, then the "victim" should be
treated as though he or she was the offender.  Examples include waiting
until you are starving before going after someone who you expect to
sleep you, deliberately refusing assistance to escape your imminent
starvation, dehydration, drowning, death, etc.

                    (see 'help Charmies and Pets')
~

-1 LAW LAWS~

LAWS

There are certain places in Exodus that follow a set of local laws.  One such
place is the city of Thesden.  In these places you are subject to the laws of
the land.  Deciding to break the laws of the land is a role-play choice made
by you.  You may wind up getting caught by the appropriate authorities in the
game or you may wind up getting away with your crime.  Immortal intervention
in local law breaking only takes place unless you have broken a law and the
Exodus program code does not recognize this.

                     (see also 'help rules')
~

-1 MULTIKILLING MULTI 'MULTI-KILLING' 'MULTIPLE DEATHS'~

MULTIKILLING

In order to give player characters time to recover from being player-killed
(PK'd), it is illegal to kill a player character a second time if they have
not had the time to completely heal from the wounds incurred from a death
that was directly caused by you.  Healing may occur naturally over the course
of time or unnaturally through the use of spells, potions or other healing
arts.  Because of variations from character to character such as different
constitutions, races, clases, ... etc., the amount of time it takes for a
character to heal varies.  If there is any question as to whether a character
has fully healed from their last ordeal with you, it is advisable to simply
not kill the player character a second time or to ask an Immortal's viewpoint
on the matter.

The exception to this rule takes place when the player character that died
intiates any sort of aggressive action towards another player character
during this healing process.  An aggressive action in this case, is defined
as any action that intiates combat with (or can cause the death of) another
player character.  Additionally, some non-combat actions in this situation
will be considered aggressive if they CAN lead to indirect PK, such as
summoning someone to an ambush.  When a player character performs an
aggressive action against another player character during the previously
mentioned healing up period, they give up all protection provided here under
multikilling rules.  (see 'help Indirect PK' for more on this.)
~

-1 NONPK ROLES 'NON-PK' 'PK ROLES' 'NON PK/PK ROLES'~

ROLES OF NON-PK AND PK CHARACTERS

Player characters on Exodus may choose to participate in killing other
player characters (known as "Player-Killing" or "PK").  Those player
characters who have decied on this course of action have either joined a
clan and have a clan symbol in front of their name on the 'WHO' list, or
have become a loner and have been marked with a [*] in front of their name
on the 'WHO' list.  The exception to this are player characers that are
members of clans that show up on the 'help clan exceptions' list.  Those that
are members of these exceptional clans are to be considered Non-PK with the
same privileges and rights as player characters who do not have a clan symbol
or loner designation in front of their name.

Non-PK player characters (noclans) may not initiate attacks upon any other
player character.  Additionally, they may not use any skills, spells, prayers
or songs upon any other player character unless they have permission to do so
by the player character on which they want to use their ability.  Those that
are found to be using their abilities on player characters against their
wishes will be designated as a loner and may see additional penalties.
Likewise, noclans may not loot or sacrifice other player
characters' corpses without the permission of the 'owner' of the corpse.
Retaliating against a noclan for using an ability or the sacrifice and/or
looting of a corpse is not acceptable.  Speak to or write to the Immortals if
this type of behavior takes place.

PK player characters may not initiate attacks on noclans. Additionally, they
may not use any skills, spells, prayers or songs upon any noclans unless they
have permission to do so by the noclan on which they want to use their ability.
Penalties for those found using their abilities on noclans against their
wishes will be given varying penalties by Immortals on a case by case basis.
This also applies to looting or sacrificing the corpses of Noclans.  In the
case where a PK player character initiated an attack on or used a skill on
a noclan without their permission, retaliating against the PK player character
is not acceptable.  Speak to or write to the Immortals if this type of behavior
takes place.

Because it is possible for Non-PK characters to take advantage of their
status regarding their immunity to certain facets of the PK world, if it is
found that a Non-PK character has been giving PK player characters an undue
advantage or hindering player characters in PK situations, the character in
question may be given the loner designation after review by an Immortal.

The roles of Non-PK player characters and PK player characters may be
temporarily changed from time to time by an Immortal that is running a quest.
The exact details regarding how the rules of these groups change, who may
participate, when the changes take place and when the roles posted here
apply again will be supplied by the questing Immortal at the time that the
quest is run.

Clans that wish to be treated as Non-PK player characters and placed on the
PK exception list, must petition the Clan Administrator.  As we are
currently only looking for a limited number of these clans, most
petitions will be turned down.

-1 BOTS ROBOTS TRIGGERS~

Triggers, robots, and bots are defined as automatic actions taken by a
player's telnet client rather than actions entered by the player
him/herself.
The official position on the legality of bots is that they are allowed so
long as the player is manning his character.  That is to say that AFK
botting
is not allowed and players who do it run the risk of being logged off or
having other players or imms do naughty things to their character while they
are away.

The degree of enforcement depends on what is happening.  If a player simply
has a void trigger to keep him out of the void or a food trigger to
automatically feed himself, we don't mind because it has no real effect on
the game or on the other players.  Bots that perform actions to group
members
while the character is AFK, however, are not allowed and are punishable.

As a general rule of thumb, if you are botting AFK and it's in a way where
any other player notices it, you may want to rethink it.
~

-1 LOOTING LOOT~
 
This is a way to steal an opponents equipment, LOOTING is only allowed
between playerkillers.  NoPK players are not allowed to take part in
LOOTING another players corpse.
 
LOOTING is defined as: The removal of eq from the corpse, or ground from a
recently butchered corpse of another player.

Some monsters in Exodus loot as well.  It's important not to confuse looting
mobs with scavenger mobs.  Scavenger mobs will pick up items that lie on the
ground.  Scavenger mobs generally do not wear the items they pick up.  If a
looting mob kills you, it will take everything from your corpse and attempt
to wear everything.  If the mob did not kill you, it will not loot you.

EXAMPLE:
Yorl was a NoPK character.  Yorl was killing in Krathen.  He got killed by
a Krathen Flag Guard, which is a looting mob.  Yorl was looted by the flag
guard.  The flag guard is also a hunting mob, so it hunted room by room to
try to find Yorl to attack him, even though Yorl was back in Thesden at the
altar.  During the course of hunting for Yorl, the flag guard entered a
player room which was attached to Krathen.  On the tick, the mob "wandered
on home" with all of Yorl's equipment.  This is fantastically bad luck,
akin to having an avatar get poisoned and then having the poison kill the
avatar five seconds later.  This is also a natural part of gameplay, and
therefore does not qualify for reimbursement or immortal intervention.

The following variations would have been illegal since Yorl was NoPK:
* A player kills the mob and then loots the equipment.
* A player teleports the mob out of the area to make Yorl lose his eq.
* A player charms the mob and keeps it away from Yorl.
* Any other player action that prevents Yorl from getting his gear.
~

-1 BOARDS 'NOTE BOARDS'~

USE OF THE NOTE BOARDS

The board system of Exodus is broken down into Penalties, News, Changes,
Ideas, Poetry, OOCNotes and RPNotes.  The first three are boards that only
immortals can post to.  However, the Idea and Note boards are able to be
posted on by both mortals and immortals alike.  Your ideas and notes are
welcome on the boards as long as they are within certain guidelines.
Non-roleplay flaming of any player is not allowed on the boards, which
includes 'Immbashing'.  Immortals take time out of their real world day to
work on Exodus without getting paid.  As such, they are not to be openly
criticized on open channels and in posts on the boards addressed to 'all'.
Unless given permission to do so by an Immortal, repeating a private
conversation on a board is forbidden.  You may say whatever you would like
to those you know on Exodus regarding your feelings about the Immortals as
long as is done in private notes or through the use of 'tells'.  The boards
are available for role-play, clan matters, questions and constructive
comments about game play and other non-personal matters.  If you abuse the
privilege of posting to the boards, you may be warned regarding this
behavior and/or have your player character frozen, denied or deleted.

      (see 'help Channel Abuse' for information regarding vulgarity.)
~

-1 'PK LEVELS'~

PK LEVELS

The following is a list of PK level guidelines:

   * Do not attack, kill, charm or initiate aggressive non-combat action
     (see 'help indirect pk') on any player character level 8 or lower.
   * Level 8 or lower player characters may not attack or initiate
     aggressive non-combat actions toward any player characters or kill any
     player characters.

Out of Level (OOL) PKilling is legal within the realms of Exodus.  If you
kill a player character that is more than eight levels below your current
level you will lose a tremendous amount of experience -- with the greater
the level difference, the greater your loss.  Players grouped with you at
the time of killing will be punished in the same fashion, althoguh they
may or may not be able to appeal that based on extenuating circumstances.

Retaliation against a player character who killed you that is more than
eight levels below your current level is not allowed.  Be prepared to lose
experience if you wish to retaliate and you wind up killing that player
character.  Additional penalties may be given out by Immortals.
~

1 REIMB REIMBURSEMENTS~

There are times when mortal characters lose experience and equipment unfairly.
In almost every one of these cases, it is due to a bug in the code.  It is
the policy of the MUD that if the code is at fault, we will reimb experience
and/or equipment to characters that experienced a loss directly due to the
bug.  For the purposes of this helpfile, a 'bug' is defined as code in place
that is not functioning as it has been designed.

Additionally, if a character loses their corpse and the MUD crashes, they are
entitled to a reimb of equipment, provided that they didn't lose their corpse
a week ago... etc.  Use judgement in cases like this.

  Specific Reimb Details:
    We will reimb up to, but not exceeding, 30 pieces of equipment.
    Equipment is considered anything a character can carry.  If a player lost
    100 mushrooms, they may have 30 if they wish, and nothing else.  Reimbed
    equipment should only be gear that has a rarity no higher than 'rare'.
    'Very Rare' gear will only be reimbed if there was some sort of proof
    (such as another player's testimony) that the gear really existed.
    We will NOT remib gear that did not belong to the character or that the
    character did not lose because of a 'bug' (or MUD crash).

The following items are never reimbursed:
Runes, Quest Tokens, Money, Enchanted Items (Item replaced, but not enchanted)

Reimbursement appeals (for instances where a bug did not take place) may be
directed to the Imp for a final decision on whether the gear will be reimbed
or not.

Players who delete voluntarily and then come back some time later are
usually very welcome back on Exodus.  We love to have old players again,
but these people do NOT qualify for reimbursement of levels, equipment, or
anything the old character had.  Reimbursement is reserved for loss that
happens to players as a result of an unplanned event in the game, such as
a crash.  We are not doing this to be jerks, but we want to make it clear
that delete is not the same as hibernation or storage.
~

-1 DUEL ARENA~

There exists an arena here, shaped in legend and stone, where
heroes of pages past and future have aspired to etch their names
in the Book of Legends.

In the Arena, players can duel one another, within a ten level limit,
to the death without worry of loss of equipment or experience.
There is also a room where Spectators may go to watch and wager
on the fights.  In the Arena, all combatants are given an Arena issue
set of equipment with which the duel is rendered more equal.

When two characters agree to a duel, they are instantaneously transported
to the Arena for a duel to the death.  The winner receives a portion
of the proceeds from the sale of tickets.  The loser is transported
back to the Hall of Legends where perhaps he can try again to be made
Legend.

The Book of Legends records the Heroes who have distinguished themselves
with their remarkable skill.

Players can duel here without being loners or clanned, and will not become
loners or clanned due to any fighting here.

SYNTAX:

duel: shows you the current duel information.
duel add: adds you to the public duel list.
duel withdraw: withdraws your current request for a duel.
duel <player>: sends a duel request to a player currently logged in.
duel cancel: may be used by immortals to cancel any duel.

0 'CLAN WAR' DESECRATE SANCTIFY CW~

In the ongoing battle for supremacy between guilds, allies and enemies
are formed between factions, and these factions work to both advance their
own status in the realms, and destroy status gained by others.  The
declaration of allies and the subsequent garnering of enemies is both
essential and inevitable in the harsh environment that clan life creates.
Specific commands for the administering of such clan interchanges are as
follows:

cw <message>:
 Broadcasts a message via semi-magical, semi-mundane means over an allied
 war channel.  All allied clans will see your message at the cost of one
 half of the broadcaster's movement and one fourth of their mana.

clan ally <clan name>:
 Declares this clan as an ally.  Each clan may have a maximum of
 one ally per 300 cumulative member levels.

clan enemy <clan name>:
 Declares this clan as an enemy clan.  A clan may have an infinite amount
 of enemies.

clan declare <clan name>:
 Proposes war upon a clan that has been declared enemy for more than 5
 hours.  War lasts approximately 48 real-time hours, and the winner is
 determined by comparing the total number of opposing clan members killed
 by either side.  If a clan loses a war, its members will only gain 1/4
 the normal experience from killing monsters that they would normally
 gain for one game day.

sanctify:
 After killing every single monster in an area to gain dominance of that
 area, a rune must be used to sanctify that dominance before the mobiles
 repopulate the area.

 Once an area has been deemed sanctified and dominated, members of the
 conquering clan gain protection from aggressive monsters in that area,
 increased experience, and fame (your clan name will appear on the area
 list for as long as you hold dominance).

desecrate:
 Using a rune, an enemy clan may venture into the dominated area of their
 rivals, drive their enemies out, and kill all the monsters within the area
 to remove another clan's dominance from that area.  Once a land is
 desecrated, it may be resanctified by any other clan (with the appropriate
 rune and actions).

~

-1 LONER~

Player Killing is a legal option only to those who are members of
clans or who have loner status.  You can make yourself a loner one of
four ways: 1) type clan loner, 2) defect or get expelled from a clan
or be a member of a clan that is later disbanded for whatever reason,
3) Player Kill someone outside of an arena, or 4) steal unsuccessfully
from another player.  Note that loner status is permanent, and can only
be removed by an immortal of high rank.

Note additionally that it is illegal to player kill unless you and your
victim are both level 9 or above, and are a loner or a member of a clan,
and that once you are marked as either of these, you are an open target
for player killing.
~

0 RUNE RUNES 'WARP STONE' 'WARP STONES' 'CONVEYANCE STONES'~
Runes are at once the most desired and the least available items in all
of the realms of Exodus.  With them, the leaders and members of clans
may call upon the vast energies stored within the runes to perform great
deeds such as the sanctification or desecration of lands.

A focal point of energy in the universe at the time of epistemological
concurrence in two realms or more results in these runes being found on
the corpses of recently deceased things -- so it is vitally important for
anyone interested in discovering a rarity such as this to thoroughly
peruse any corpse that he or she might come across (or make) in his or
her adventures.

Conveyance stones, one of the cornerstones of mage and cleric existence,
are unusual items that carry the properties allowing large amounts
of magical or holy power to be channeled through them.  The upper echelon
of bodily transportation spells or prayers require focal point such as
these to channel supernatural power into to work correctly.

-1 BAYOU~
`cThe Bayou Teche``
A bayou is actually a water passage through a swamp, but in many cases,
the term is used to define the swamp itself. The Bayou Teche is a wet
and nasty place where only the hardiest of creatures survive. It is a
place of Spanish moss and cypress trees that grow out of standing knee
deep water and quicksand both. There is high ground in the swamp if it
can be found, and a few treasures as well.

It is very easy to become lost in the swamps if one isn't careful, and
there are plenty of creatures who would like a lost wanderer as lunch!
A seasoned adventurer won't have much trouble in Teche, while the novice
will find plenty to keep him busy. The people of the village are not the
friendliest of folks, but they aren't the mean sort either. If you go
to the swamps, pack an extra lunch, as you may need it...
~

-1 SUN 'CITY OF THE SUN'~
`oThe City of the `kSun``
        There is a legend, whispered in hushed voices among the people of
the jungle.  They speak in fear and awe of a massive city, filled with
treasure and power.  It is said to be on an island, hidden afar off in a
slow muddy river.
        Sometimes rumor is heard of the great warriors from that city,
always covered in bright feathered armor, who swoop suddenly down upon a
village.  They capture all the people and drag them off to some hideous
fate.  None are ever seen again.
        The Sun and Moon and many gods are worshipped in that city; the
priestly class comprises nearly half the population.  Lately a few events
of import have occurred:  the King has sent word that a treasure, precious to
him was lost in shipment; the Priest of the Moon is consumed with seeking
the noblest warrior in the land;  the clan leaders have gathered to organize
another raid on a nearby village.  A new region of the island has been
drained and paved and new construction has begun.  You may even be allowed
to add a home of your own if it is in keeping with the style of the city.
        If you are resourceful enough find the City of the Sun, tread warily
within, and watch closely to learn their ways.  Such knowledge may serve you
very well.

-1 NREYTH~
HISTORY OF THE VRO'ATH CITY OF NRE'YTH
	Originally founded as a military outpost by the Vro'ath Marshal
Hadukk, Nre'yth is conveniently located in a small, rocky valley between
two mountains - Aven Talir to the west and Aven Teluk to the east.  One
of the first projects that Hadukk organized was designed to improve the
defenses of the outpost.  He ordered walls be built at the north and
south ends of the valley, which would effectively seal up Nre'yth since
the steep mountain slopes to the east and west were natural barriers.
While Vro'ath are adept at constructing walls and other military
fortifications, Hadukk still hired some dwarves for help, mainly to mine
building materials from the nearby mountains.
	After the completion of the walls, Hadukk felt secure enough to
allow a civilian population inside Nre'yth, as long as the residents
would accept martial rule.  Indeed, Nre'yth became a key defensive
stronghold for the Vro'ath.  With adequate supplies and soldiers, Hadukk
felt that the city could endure multi-year sieges.  Also, Nre'yth lies in
the way of one of the few routes for traveling to the northern parts of
the continent.  This allowed the Vro'ath city to dominate a key trade
route to the north.
	Naturally, the humans living to the south resented the Vro'ath
control of a key trade route to the north. Some hotheads organized a
force to seize Nre'yth.  Knowing that a direct assault upon the walls
would be futile, the humans bribed some dwarves for help.  These dwarves
showed the humans some passages through the mines in Aven Talir and Aven
Teluk which were unknown to the Vro'ath.  Coming out of these mine
passages, the human attackers were able to surprise the unprepared
Vro'ath garrison inside the city.
	The humans nearly seized control of Nre'yth, if not for the
discipline of the Vro'ath soldiers, which kept them from panicking, and
the foresight of Marshal Hadukk.  Knowing that Nre'yth was located in a
strategically important spot, Hadukk had predicted an attack on the city
weeks in advance and had requested reinforcements from other Vro'ath
leaders.  Led by Marshal Bujaghn, the reinforcements came in time to save
the city for the Vro'ath.  Unfortunately, Bujaghn was not in time to save
his colleague Hadukk, who was killed in a ferocious, almost suicidal,
charge by a band of human knights.  The arrival of Bujaghn's forces
turned the tide, and almost all the human attackers were either killed or
captured.  The few dwarven accomplices of the humans were also caught.
	As punishment, Bujaghn put the human and dwarven captives to work
in the mines. One of their first tasks was to collapse those passages
which would undermine the defense of the city.  Furthermore, Bujaghn
decided that he would enslave these humans for the rest of their lives.
At this point, the Vro'ath religious leaders intervened. Such an act of
cruelty would only reinforce the Vro'ath "brute" image that other races
saw.  The Vro'ath priests worked diligently to banish such an image from
everyone's eyes. However, Bujaghn would not budge in his position; he
felt that slave was more than those human captives deserved. A compromise
was reached: Bujaghn would be allowed keep his slaves, but they were to
be well treated and released after serving faithfully for five years.
However, Bujaghn negotiated a couple important concessions from the
Vro'ath church leaders. First, owners of slaves were allowed to sell
slaves as property.  Second, all future prisoners captured in military
encounters with the Vro'ath would also be subjected to slavery.  Thus,
Bujaghn can be considered the founder of the Vro'ath slave trade.  He
also organized the first slave raiding parties.  These were small bands
of highly trained Vro'ath soldiers who attacked frontier human
settlements or groups of unsuspecting travelers, never with the intent to
kill, but only to capture humans alive.  The Vro'ath religious leaders
grumbled a bit about this, but they grudgingly ignored these acts as long
as the slaves were allowed to free after five years.
	At present, Nre'yth is still primarily a trading city, with slaves
being the major commodity.  Slave raiders still exist, but they now
include other races as targets for slaves.  Rule in the city is a tenuous
balance of power between the leaders of the church and the military.  The
current leaders of Nre'yth are Marshal Torqenuk and High Priest il'Reshaz.

`cT=forest `e ^=water  `c_=plains  `d#=city  `o[]=castle Dunluce``

-The city of Thesden is located in a temperate climate on the
southeastern corner of the continent. Bordered by forest and plains
to the north and west and water to the south and east. The Severn
River flows through the center of town and empties into Colwyn
Bay. The docks are located on the bay in the southwest part of town.
The Bay, in turn empties into the great eastern ocean. Castle
Dunluce southeast of town, a long path leading up to its main gates.
The Castle stands well above the town, perched on the cliffs
southeast of town, water or perilous drops on all sides. To the east of
town is leagues of farmland.


Brief History:

-In ancient days, the lands now occupied by the city of Thesden were
temperate forest. A tribe of elves made their home in this forest, and
defended it against any attackers, particularly the degenerate orcs
who feared the elves even more than they feared their own kings.
Sea travelers occasionally stopped in Colwyn Bay, as it was good
protection from rough seas, and safe lands (though it is doubtful the
travelers and merchants knew it) because of the elves. Some of these
folk settled, and spent their lives fishing. The village of Thesden
begin, and the elves remained aloof yet harbored no ill will against
the burgeoning village. In those days, the town was organized by a
small council and it grew rapidly. In those days, a pantheon of gods
were worshipped, Urderan the god of deep waters and Ayvril god of
storm and plenty being the most prominent.

-As the years past, the town grew quickly, becoming an important
center of trade, initially for basic goods like food, but increasingly
for textiles due to the mines beginning to be excavated not far from
town. Things were going well until a series of bad events led to a
dark time. For the first time, the mysterious plague hit, killing many
of the people. Strangely, at the same time as the plague, a massive
army of orcs came from the north, decimating elves and humans
alike. The army was finally defeated, but only at great cost.

-For protection, and as a result of the new ties between elf and
human, a treaty was forged. The people of Thesden agreed to leave a
large portion of the forests west of Thesden unharvested, to help
defend the forests against attackers, and to assist the elves with food
and any other aid they needed. The elves, in turn, helped with the
magics necessary to build Castle Dunluce. At the same time, the
town council agreed to hand over power to the man they had
appointed general during the war, Ythran Athanmere, made first
king of Castle Dunluce. As a way of sealing the ties, the second born
of the Athanmere line was always wed to one of the elves, creating
an entire noble class of half-elven. It is said that those who call
themselves Rangers now may be descendants of these half-elven
knights. Also, one of the elvish elders always acted as advisor to the
king. And so it was, for many years.

-Years later, as tensions built between elf and human, the city grew,
beliefs changed. Many people began to follow the Church with the
its one God of fire and hope and its cult of martyrs. The tensions
broke and erupted into a civil war. As one tale goes, the elves failed
to warn the town of an incoming attack, allowing an army of Orcs to
burn much of the outlying farms and reach the gates of the castle
itself before they were stopped. Many believe the elves feared the
humans would begin to log the forest in their need for trees. Lord
Devon Athanmere, newly appointed king, it is said, banished the
elves from the court, ordering the beheading of the elvish advisor
Eyth'reane on grounds of being a traitor. Another, very different
tale, seldom told by anyone except the most fanciful bards of the
college, says that young Devon Athanmere, first-born, was deeply in
love with the elvish princess Llynilon. When it was announced that
his younger brother would marry the princess, as tradition held,
Devon slew his brother in a fit of rage. Llynilon, distraut at having
lost her future husband whom she did indeed love, took her life by
jumping off the parapets of Castle Dunluce. The elves, shocked by
the injustice, and blaming Devon, withdrew and lets the orcs
approach town. Whichever story is true, Devon had his advisor
Eyth'reane beheaded, and ordered all elves banished or killed. The
half-elves, too, were driven out, called degenerates. Though it is
rumored that many of them did little more than move into the forest
outside town to become rangers. Devon did not last long on the
throne, he mysteriously died after dinner one evening. One of the
king's knights, the strong Ihnian Toryn took the throne. He claimed
to be a cousin to Devon, took the Athanmere name and enshrined
the memory of Devon naming the central town square after him.
The remaining close relatives of the Athanmeres also mysteriously
disappeared after voicing opposition.

-The descendants of Ihnian Toryn Athanmere have ruled since that
day. The elves have withdrawn and have not been heard much from
since. Ihnian's own Knights of the Argent Lance have defended the
town against attack, and the day to day running of the town has been
left to an appointed mayor. The current king, Ferath Athanmere has
ruled for the last 20 years.

92 'IMMORTAL LAWS'~

*   Don't kill mortals, threaten to kill them, suggest that others kill them,
    or endanger them in ANY way.  This includes transferring/summoning them
    to aggressive mobs.

*   Having fun is the point - like switching into mobs, or forcing players
    to do silly things.  But if a mortal asks you to leave them alone, do so
    immediately.

*   Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.  If you wish to be helpful
    make a mortal character to help with. (If there is a special case that
    requires exception, be ready with a GOOD reason.)

*   You may have other characters, and those characters may be in clans.
    Here are the guildlines for second characters:

        *We would prefer if you do not use any character to LEAD a clan.

        *Don't share specialized imm information. (Such as- identity of
         other players; information about areas, objects, or mobs;
         details about other clans.)

        *Don't do anything that could even give the semblance of cheating,
         or you risk losing both of your characters.  This includes leveling
         extraordinarily fast via supernatural means.

*   Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.

*   Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled, do not restore
    their privileges.  They are being punished for a reason.

*   Note also that asking for promotion is considered an annoyance,
    and will not be reacted to kindly.  Promotions will be handed
    out as the admin team sees fit.
~

92 'Public Relations'~
There are a couple of different kinds of Immortals on Exodus.  One kind is
a 'coder' Immortal who has been created in order to test new code.  The other
kind is an Admin immortal.  Admins can be regular immortals whose sole job is
to help newbies and answer questions or they may have more specialized roles
such as being in charge of Clans, Questing or Law.

Whether you are a coder Immortal or one of the Admin persuasion, you are
expected to follow the guidelines found in 'help immortal laws' to the
letter.  Additionally, there are a few pointers that need to be followed when
dealing with the mortal population.

  *  When speaking to mortals, ALWAYS try your very best to be 'visible' to
  the mortals you are speaking to.  There may be instances when this isn't
  possible for whatever reason, but those instances should be very rare.

  *  As stated in 'help immortal laws' do NOT kill mortals under any
  circumstances.  There may be a very rare instance where it is necessary to
  slay a mortal for misbehavior, but again, this should be extremely rare.

  *  It is very fun to play with mortals by switching into mobs.  Be very
  prepared to wind up killing mortals if you play with them by switching into
  naturally aggressive mobs.  Make no mistake -- if you are switched into an
  aggressive mob, you WILL wind up killing a mortal at some point as you will
  not have full control over that mob's actions.  (Read above point regarding
  killing mortals).   Mortals do not like being killed by Immortals under any
  reason, whether they are being played with or not, with the exception of
  when quests are run.  So, if you want to have fun with them, the best way
  to do this is to run a quest.  By doing this you cover yourself should a
  mortal die and you make points with mortals because they like quests.

  *  Roleplay is to be encouraged on Exodus, whether you are an Immortal
  roleplaying or a mortal.  However, it has been found that Immortals
  roleplaying a relationship with mortals tends to create a lot of confusion
  on the MUD from a player standpoint and can even affect the Immortal
  Staff as a whole in some rare instances.  For this reason please do not
  roleplay relationships with mortals (which includes net sex).  You are more
  than welcome to create a mortal character for this type of roleplay.

  *  Coder Immortals, as stated above, are in existence to test code on the
  live port.  As this is so, coder immortal interaction with the mortal
  population on Exodus should be kept down to a bare minimum.  It is the job
  of Admin Immortals to deal with the Exodus population in matters of helping
  newbies, answering questions, running quests, making sure rules are
  followed, and other related issues.

  *  If a mortal writes to you specifically, please respond to them in a
  prompt fashion if their note requires a response.  Not responding to
  notes written specifically to you is a huge irritant to the mortal
  population as a whole.  It's simply a matter of courtesy.  If you wrote to
  them about a question or an important matter, you would expect a prompt
  reply (if they were logged on).  So please, try to respond to your notes as
  soon as conveniently possible.
~

92 BUILDING_HINTS~

Here is important building information that will be changed often depending
on the state of the mud.

Important things: Please only build (with olc not the build command cuz
the build command saves things to one player based area file) area rooms
now. The reasoning for this is that we have so many mob/obj flags to add,
that if you build them now, you might not build as completely as you could.

Remember that when you build your room descriptions, the sky is the limit.
Just because we dont have a flag now or a function now that would complement
your area doesn't mean that you can't code it with its ideal implementation
in mind.

Keep in consideration:

  1) if you are building a CITY, use the JUSTICE flag for all rooms
     that you want to be administered to by the city's law enforcement.
     I'm revamping the wanted system to incorporate a working jail.

  2) also keep in mind that sector flags are no longer as arbitrary as they
     have been in the past. the player BUILD command will use sector
     flags extensively to determine cost, defense/attack bonuses, etc.
     So please choose fastidiously!

* 3) I changed it so the default is NO_BUILD.  If you want people to be
     able to build from your area/room, please use the BUILD flag!

  4) ALL FUTURE ROOMS must be marked with the appropriate flag.
     The default for no time period flag is Medieval.

  5) You can make special things in your area special colors.
     Type 'help speshul' for an unorganized list of these colors.
     All colors are coded with the backtic key `Z and the
     corresponding letter/number as shown in the help file.

* 6) OBJ MATERIAL types will determine
     eq restrictions, class restrictions, etc. use wisely.
     The default is NONMETAL, please toggle it for metal things.

* 7) We will be using mob_size, as well as char_size. Choose wisely.

* 8) The primary weapon for MAGES is the staff group, this includes
     spears.  The primary weapon for CLERICS is the mace group, this
     includes flails.  The primary weapon for BARDS AND THIEVES are
     daggers.  Everything else falls under some WARRIOR/RANGER category.

* 9) Mobs shouldn't be set/loaded/created with a lot of wealth,
     unless its for a reason.  Meaning, dont give your mobs a lot
     of gold/silver unless they are a merchant or trader or something.

* 10) Please consult madrom.doc on the ftp site for level/armor/weapon
      levels.
~

92 'IMMSTORE'~

Creating a shopkeeper for a player store:

You should first create a mobile, as usual.  Once this mobile is created,
you may set the 'pskeeper' recruit flag by typing 'recruit pskeeper' from
the mobile editor.  Once this flag has been added, there are two values
that may be set, 'psvnum' and 'pscost'.  'psvnum' should be set to the
vnum of the player store to which this mobile can be hired.  For example,
if a player owns a store in room number 25001, typing 'psvnum 25001' allows
this mobile to be hired for that store.  PScost allows you to set how much
it costs to hire this mobile, in silver, per hour.  Please note: all
player-store shopkeepers should be between the vnum range of 12714 and
12913.

Setting permanent stock:

Immortals may set permanent stock in a player store by using the "set room"
command with "stock" as an option.  For example, "set room 25001 4000" will
add the object with vnum 4000 to the permanent inventory of the player
store in room 25001.  By adding an additional argument, you may set the
cost of the object in silver -- "set room 25001 4000 3000" adds the
object, giving it a cost of 3000 silver in this store.
~

92 'IMMOTRAL INACTIVITY'~
Immortal Inactivity

Since Exodus has been around since 1996, there are large number of immortals who
have come and gone over the years.  Many of them have deleted or been deleted,
but most of them have just faded off into the sunset, leaving their characters
in a sort of stasis.  Exodus does not delete players for inactivity and immortals
are treated the same way.  However, due to the nature of the powers of an
immortal character, these loose ends must be tied up in a way that minimizes the
security threat to Exodus in general.  Therefore, as of November 9, 2003, the
immortal council of Minax, Kalus, Iverath, Iblis, and Zeraeka have decided that
the following will happen to any immortal character who takes an unannounced
leave of absense from Exodus for more than 60 calendar days:

The immortal's title will be changed to reflect the old level and current date.
The immortal's level will be reduced to 92.
The immortal will be forced wizi.
If applicable, shell access on the Claret server will be suspended.
*Shinowlan, as owner of Claret, is exempt from this rule.

This is not a forced permanent retirement.  If the immortal comes back after
a time and genuinely wishes to become an active member of the Exodus immortal
community, that immortal will be given the opportunity to earn the levels back.
This is not a disciplinary action, but rather, it is a security measure.
This document was unanimously approved by the immortal council of Minax, Kalus,
Iverath, Iblis, and Zeraeka on November 9, 2003.

92 QUESTGUIDE~

Quest: To seek a prize, or the act of seeking that prize.

What a simple definition for such a wonderful thing. Well planned quests set
MUDs like Exodus apart from the rest of the hum-drum slay and level MUDs that
can be anywhere. Take pride in your quests and make them fun. Don't go hogwild
on prizes, or they will become common, but instead make the whole experience an
enjoyable challenge that will make the players look forward to many more.

Quests come in two general catagories: Impromptu and Planned. Impromptu quests
are just small fun quests that can be run any time, for almost any reason.
Planned quests are much more elaborate, more dificult, have bigger prizes,
etc. Regardless the type of quest you run, remember: the purpose of the quest
is to have fun.

How to set up a quest:
  (note - this is For Large, multi-hour, Multi-day or all Day Quests, not
   short, half hour impromptu quests)

  A. Immortal run quests:

    1.  Note your proposed quest to the QuestMaster at least 3 days before
        you plan to run it
      a.  Try to include if possible:
        1) Quest concept
        2) The immortals involved in the quest other than yourself.
        3) Name of the quest
        4) Prize(s) to be awarded (stats, name, etc.)
        5) Level range of the quest
        6) Date and time to be run
        7) Mud resources required (Mobs, objects, rooms, etc)
        8) Type of quest (please see help qtype)
      b. If you would like help in some of the above areas.. just ask.

  B.  Mortal run quests with Immortal assistance:

    1.  Mortals may submit ideas for quests or run their own quests under the
        same guidelines as in the Immortal run quests section.
    2.  If Immortal assistance is required for the running of the quest,
          any Immortal can assist if he/she agrees.
    3.  Immortals may not assist Mortals in knowledge based quests.
    4.  The quest will be monitored for fairness.
    5.  If the prize is created by an Immortal, it must be held by An Immortal
        until completion of the quest, and shall be awarded to the winner by
        the immortal.

*** and above all.. if the quest isn't fun... its not a quest.  ***

92 QPREP~

Prizes and Announcements

  A.  The quest must be worthy of the prize and fit the theme of the quest.
        e.g. a bounty hunter quest would/could have money for the prize.
  B.  Load or gather the prize(s) beforehand, and have it ready with
        everything but the winners name.
  C.  Enchants and Restrings should not be given as a "default prize". We don't
      want them to become too comon.
  E.  Quest prizes MUST be restrung with QUESTPRIZE into the name (keyword, not desc)
  G.  If the prize is for a Mortal-run quest, the prize must be held by an
      Immortal until completion of the quest.

      includes pkill, it must be cleared through the QuestMaster AND an IMP first. NO
      EXCEPTIONS)
  I.  Announce the quest and rules: If a spontanious quest, announce over gossip
      channel. If planned, announce at least 3 days prior to quest.

92 QPRIZE~

Quest prize guidelines:

  A.  Quest item Maximums and restrictions:
    1.  No more than +1 bonuses per 8 levels of the maximum level range of the
        quest (I.E. a level 50-80 quest cannot have more than +10 bonus to any
        quest item.
    2. All quest prizes must be approved by the QuestMaster prior to running of
	the quest.
       a. Average damage of weapons cannot exceed 120% that of weapons designed for
          level of weapon. In other words, no level 1 swords with average
          damage of 50.
       b. Do not lower levels of existing items.
    4.  Spells/Potions, etc.
      Spells/potions are a good prize for quick or easy quests. Especially for newbie quests.

            powerful than mortal brews.

  B.  Quest Tokens
     Quest tokens can be used for all types of quests, to be saved and redeemed at a later date
     for prizes, or saved up for *special* prizes. No more than 5 quest tokens should be given
     as a prize, and even then, only for the *hardest* of quests.

  C.  Quest Type/Prize recommendation

92 COMBAT_QUEST~

STORY/PLOT LINE

Every quest should have a story.  This is the starting point. This is
where the hype begins and the players begin to salivate.  A plot that
players can identify with and impacts them personally in the game, are the
kinds that will intrigue players the most.  Another method of adding or
extending a storyline is to introduce long-term foes. Long-term foes that
turn up from time to time to make life difficult for the players add to
the story.  In other terms, this would be called a campaign.  Stories are
limited only to the imagination.

PUZZLES/BRAINTEASERS

  Next in line are the puzzles and brainteasers.  Players should never be
allowed to go from the starting point (story/plot) to the combat sequence
without being forced to resolve some kind of puzzle or a multitude of
puzzles.  There are many kinds of puzzles from the traditional riddles to
complex puzzles.  Multiple puzzles allow teams to compete against each
other in a race to solve the puzzles the quickest.  One example of a
puzzle is to tell players to find and goto multiple locations without
transport spells using the clues you provide.

COMBAT

  Combat is the next element of the quest.  Combat can be the climax of
the quest or an anti-climax depending on whether you wish to stress the
puzzles or the combat sequences.

  If you want the puzzles to be the focus, place more emphasis on the
puzzles by making them tougher and taking more time to resolve than
defeating the combat mob.  If you want the combat sequences to be the
focus, make the mob extremely difficult to kill and take up more time than
the puzzles.  When creating mobs for the players to fight, consider giving
the mob equipment that fits in with the storyline.  Even minor trappings
like bracers or rings can be used to add flavor. For lower level questers,
just make certain that you get the items back, period.  Do NOT leave quest
eq in the players hands.

Remember, it is your quest, you set the rules.  Multiplay is NOT ALLOWED
in any quests ... PERIOD. Pkill is only allowed with prior QuestMaster and
IMP approval.

92 IMMQUEST~

Immortal prize guidelines

All items *must* be approved by the QuestMaster, prior to running the quest, with
one exception: Tokens. No more than 5 tokens may be given as prize for any quest
without prior approval of the QuestMaster. Tokens (or prize equivelants) should be
handed out based on the dificulty of the quest. If you have questions about what
to give out as prizes, please leave note to the QuestMaster.

~

92 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

92 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>
        zecho <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Zecho sends the
message to players in the same area that you are currently occupying.
Any higher-level god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing
him or her that it is an echo.
~

92 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally
invisible to players that are of a level less than 60.
~

92 PUNISHMENTS~
These are guidelines for punishments based on what we have been giving
for common offenses.  Some of these may be a bit harsh for first offenses
and they may be light for extreme cases.

Basic Multiplay - 1 week freeze of both characters.
EQ Passing      - Confiscate items and 1 week freeze for both characters.
AFK Botting     - 540-2160 ticks (6-24 hours) in jail based on severity.
Indirect PK     - 540 ticks (6 hours) in jail.
Channel abuse   - 1-2160 ticks (0-24 hours) nochannel based on severity.
Crashing Exodus - Freeze and/or Siteban until further notice.

When in doubt, freeze the player and note it and I'll take care of it when
I get on the game.

--Minax
~

92 TOLL~
Syntax: toll <gold fee> <damage fee>

Toll is a radical invention to combat the incessant whining and sheer
volume of tells the imms were receiving from some players.  When you turn
on a toll, players must pay to talk to you.  This also applies to telepath,
reply, and it even works when you're AFK.

When a player sends you a tell, the toll attempts to subtract the fee in
gold from the money the player has in pocket.  If that is not sufficient,
it attempts to deduct it from the player's bank account.  If that is not
sufficient, it applies damage to the player in the amount specified.

Use toll with caution because once you turn it on, it affects everyone who
sends you a tell.  Obviously, it's an asshole tactic to combat asshole
abuse from asshole players.  It's going to piss people off if you use it
frequently or if you forget to turn it off and go afk.
~

92 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

92 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

92 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off,
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here),
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

92 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

92 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regardless of location.
~

93 WHOINFO~

Use the whoinfo command to change your [LEV RACE CLASS] status information
to a freeform (13 character limit, everything after is truncated) text string.

Syntax: whoinfo <whoinfo information>

Example:

> whoinfo I AM GOD
> who

[    I AM GOD    ]  Mudguy the mud player.
~

93 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
        teleport <character> <location>
        teleport all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.
~

93 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

93 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

94 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles and players with a particular
name.  Typing mwhere without an argument shows you the location of
all players in the realms.
~

94 OWHERE~
Syntax: owhere <name>

Owhere shows you the locations of all objects with a particular name. This tends
to be spammy, with personal boxes and all.
~

94 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

94 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

94 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

95 SOCKETS NEWSOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name>
	newsockets
	newsockets <name>
SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).

NEWSOCKETS is like sockets, with more info and different formatting.
~

95 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

95 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

95 JAIL~
Syntax: jail <player>

The jail command currently throws a player into the Thesden jail, regardless
of his or her location in the world of Exodus.  As when jailed by cityguards,
their belongings are donated into the donation box in Thesden.  Once jailed,
you may customize a player's jail time by using the command 'set char <player>
jailed <ticks>'.
~

95 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

95 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

95 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

95 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

95 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 97 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

95 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character>

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Pardon works for players who are wanted or
jailed.  If jailed, they will be released.  If wanted, their wanted flag
will be removed.
~

96 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

96 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

96 SET FLAG~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>
	flag mob  <name> <field> <flags>
	flag char <name> <field> <flags>
	flag obj  <name> <field> <flags>
	flag room <room> <field> <flags>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)

Flag is used to toggle flags on various data structures. Some things must be 
done in set, the others in flag.
~

96 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 91), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

96 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag set (i.e. the 
donation box, the fountain, shopkeepers).  Mobiles may be purged if they are 
called directly by name.

PC's may be purged. This dumps their link and quits for them.
~

97 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

97 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

98 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

-1 BANK WITHDRAW BALANCE DEPOSIT~

After your hard adventuring and pillaging, you can deposit and withdraw
your weighty coins in the Exodus bank system. Differing towns have
different taxes, so be aware where you deposit your money. You can learn
the tax rates of the current city by visiting the local city hall.

SYNTAX:

WITHDRAW <amount> <monetary type>

DEPOSIT <amount> <monetary type>

BALANCE
~

98 REWARD~
Syntax: reward <character> <experience points> <message>

The reward command allows you to grant from -3000 to 3000 experience points
to a character.  The character will see the message string supplied and
any level gains that the experience might cause.  This command is supplied
primarily for quest purposes.  Please note that as the only text the character
may see when rewarded is <message> that this string should be creative
and descriptive of what has happened to cause the reward.  For example,
if a character has found a secret item needed to complete a question you
might type:

reward Murk 100 For finding the secret thingybob you earn 100 experience!

Murk will see:
For finding the secret thingybob you earn 100 experience!

You will see:
Ok.

This command should be used sparingly.

~

98 CHECKBUILD~
syntax: checkbuild

Checkbuild provides a list of all non-player rooms that are flagged with the
BUILD flag, meaning that players can build a private house connected to that
room.

NOTE: As of this writing, the current policy of the imms is for there to be
as few rooms flagged BUILD as possible and the imms only allow building in
approved areas.
~

99 BADSUMMON~
Syntax:  Badsummon

Badsummon is a toggle which affects the MUD globally.  When in the 'on'
position, Mages who fail casting 'summons' have a percentage of actually
summoning an aggressive mob to them that will hunt them down.

When in the 'off' position, the 'summon' spell does not have this aggressive
mob summoning feature enabled.
~

99 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

99 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

100 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

100 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

100 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

0 REVERT~
The revert command allows shape changers to return to their original
form.
~

100 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

100 ADMIN~

Syntax:	admin <message>

Sends a message to all other level 100 immortals online.
~

100 HEARCLAN~

Syntax: hearclan <clan>
	hearclan

Snoops a clan channel. Typing hearclan by itself turns it off.
~

0 $~
